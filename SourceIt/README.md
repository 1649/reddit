SourceIt
==========

When a user makes a post in the subreddit, he has a certain amount of time to provide a comment describing the post or providing a source. If he does not, the post will be removed and a warning left.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/26wjq1/red/) post met the requirement. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/26whfo/pyre/) one didn't.
