Localize
==========

This bot is only certified to work with Imgur Links


Downloads images from a subreddit.

I've left the images I tested with in this repository so you can see how it looks. Compare the names of the files inside the Images folder with the FILENAME variable from localize.py

REMEMBER that you should not download the sql.db from this repository. The bot will create its own database the first time you run it. It will also create the folder.
