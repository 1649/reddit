Newsletterbot
=============

Reddit bot sends newsletter to users when a sub gets a new post

Modify the USERNAME, PASSWORD, USERAGENT, and SUBREDDIT sections before running the bot. Reddit users can send a PM to your bot containing either 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe' to be added or removed from a newsletter mailing list, which is sent out whenever the designated subreddit gets a post.
