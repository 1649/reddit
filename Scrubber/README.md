Scrubber
==========

Banning a user from your subreddit is one thing, but sometimes you need to wipe out all traces of their existence.

It will scan /r/subreddit/new, /top, and /comments. It will then scan /u/user/submitted and /comments. It will also do a search using the author:"" tag. Any submissions or comments in your subreddit made by the user will be removed.

Reddit only allows us to grab 1,000 items from each of the five areas mentioned. We can also use the search bar to find submissions, but not comments. It may be impossible to truly scrub the user, but if it's that far back in all directions, it's probably not worth worrying about.

You must log in as a moderator, obviously.
