Jul 02 09:31:27 <captainmeta4>	I still remember most of it too
Jul 02 09:40:45 <captainmeta4>	except it was phonetic
Jul 02 09:47:09 *	cwenham predicts that after a few centuries of ubiquitous e-paper technology, our alphabet will evolve to include animated letters. The first will be the "effyouglyph", which is a hand extending the middle finger and bouncing up and down.

Jul 02 12:06:01 <gonzobot>	(creesch) I made an updated working version of reddit companion : companion - 0 comments, 1 point - creesch, 1m ago
Jul 02 12:07:47 <Soul_Shot>	wut dat
Jul 02 12:11:01 <creesch>	Soul_Shot: working version of companion :p which is a nice toolbar for reddit. 
Jul 02 12:11:34 <Soul_Shot>	oh I didn't even see that
Jul 02 12:11:37 <creesch>	Reddit once made it and then like a ton of their projects they forgot about it. 
Jul 02 12:11:37 <Soul_Shot>	I was looking on reddit itself
Jul 02 12:13:31 <Soul_Shot>	I'm still waiting for my share of Reddit Notes
Jul 02 12:13:57 <XenoBen>	didnt they can it?
Jul 02 12:18:19 <creesch>	That's the joke 
Jul 02 12:18:26 <Soul_Shot>	.lenny
Jul 02 12:18:26 <gonzobot>	( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
Jul 02 12:19:19 <creesch>	Anyway,  companion is pretty cool
Jul 02 12:19:55 <creesch>	But somehow they decided to abandon it except that they keep it on the Chrome store.  Which is silly since it is utterly broken. 
Jul 02 12:24:55 <Soul_Shot>	I imagine it has something to do with them not really caring
Jul 02 12:25:12 <Soul_Shot>	too busy deleting fph subs and whatnot
Jul 02 12:25:28 <Soul_Shot>	I sent them in a ring of like 10 websites that keep spamming my sub
Jul 02 12:25:32 <Soul_Shot>	and so far no response
Jul 02 12:25:36 <Soul_Shot>	like 4 days and counting
Jul 02 12:25:56 <creesch>	I didn't mind them doing that,  but looking at the history of this stuff they once had a bunch of awesome projects like this that would actually make Reddit better
Jul 02 12:26:07 <Cylon>	https://i.imgur.com/cSptDFS.jpg
Jul 02 12:26:09 <creesch>	Removing fph that is
Jul 02 12:26:20 <creesch>	I do mind them ignoring mail
Jul 02 12:26:52 <Soul_Shot>	Yeah, it was like a ciss of toxicity and harassment just waiting to be popped
Jul 02 12:27:02 <Soul_Shot>	People complain about coontown and whatnot
Jul 02 12:27:20 <Soul_Shot>	but you really can't compare 10,000~ subs with very little activity
Jul 02 12:27:33 <Soul_Shot>	vs 170k+ that regularily brings like pictures of dead obese people in a morgue
Jul 02 12:27:36 <Soul_Shot>	to the top of /r/all

Jul 02 13:13:47 <allthefoxes>	didnt move to sf
Jul 02 13:14:25 <kerovon>	Is that official? I head she was getting a waiver on that because she had more work to do in NY than SF.  It also seems like she had no advance notice.

Jul 02 13:17:55 <kerovon>	Yeah, that is going to cause some ripples
Jul 02 13:18:00 <kerovon>	they did it almost immediately
Jul 02 13:20:10 <kerovon>	This is also scuttling a major AMA that science was working on. Much bigger than the monsanto one.
Jul 02 13:20:57 <Flashynuff>	maybe all the mods of subreddits who were doing amas should go private

Jul 02 13:38:55 <supergauntlet>	and were just like 'xd figure it out shitters NOT OUR PROBLEM'
Jul 02 13:39:00 <Paradox>	JustPassingThrough basically i just called him out on his ego here once publicly

Jul 02 13:39:06 <Cylon>	did SHE even have notice

Jul 02 14:26:40 <cwenham>	According to the story, fired.
Jul 02 14:27:01 <XenoBen>	ouch
Jul 02 14:27:36 <cwenham>	But of course, we're only seeing one side of the story with that karmanaut post, so yada yada.
Jul 02 14:27:59 <XenoBen>	Will reddit do a announcement?
Jul 02 14:28:06 <cwenham>	Dunno.

Jul 02 14:30:32 <JustPassingThrough>	this is so dumb

Jul 02 14:30:55 <Cylon>	XenoBen, they didn't the last few times admins got fired/left
Jul 02 14:31:08 <JustPassingThrough>	yeah but they should have for them too
Jul 02 14:31:10 <XenoBen>	This had shut a big sub tho
Jul 02 14:31:24 <Cylon>	they definitely should have

Jul 02 14:42:16 <allthefoxes>	"What the shit'
Jul 02 14:42:30 <Meneth>	There will inevitably *be* drama though.
Jul 02 14:42:37 <geraldo>	they removed the post
Jul 02 14:42:41 <geraldo>	because they're bad mods
Jul 02 14:42:54 <Meneth>	I mean, I could see replacing it with a mod-run self-post so that it actually gets updated.
Jul 02 14:43:17 <geraldo>	no they removed it for lack of drama
Jul 02 14:43:22 <geraldo>	it's one of the new mods
Jul 02 14:43:37 <geraldo>	there is a post about it in /r/drama though
Jul 02 14:43:39 <geraldo>	if you're interested
Jul 02 14:43:46 <Meneth>	Yes. What I'm saying is it'd make sense to remove so a mod-run post could take its place, but removing it wholesale is just dumb.
Jul 02 14:44:26 <werner__herzog>	but wouldn't this go under "dramatic happening"?
Jul 02 14:44:34 <Meneth>	Exactly.
Jul 02 14:45:49 <geraldo>	they have some bad mods
Jul 02 14:46:14 <geraldo>	that's the problem with modding people that suck up to you and really want to mod a subreddit
Jul 02 14:46:21 <geraldo>	you create this awful mod culture
Jul 02 14:46:45 <geraldo>	where people make terrible modding decisions because they're trying to fit in

Jul 02 15:01:47 <x_minus_one>	that's sad

Jul 02 15:02:02 <Meneth>	It seems it was rather sudden too.

Jul 02 15:03:53 <andytuba>	if you want to actually interact like a poweruser then get a regular third-party app
Jul 02 15:06:08 <vertexoflife>	i wonder why they fired victoria :(
Jul 02 15:06:11 <allthefoxes>	its one of these days http://i.imgur.com/ypCSG4i.jpg
Jul 02 15:07:02 <joyouscacophony>	what's the over/under on direct conflict with chairman pao vertexoflife?
Jul 02 15:07:30 <Meneth>	If I had to take a wild guess, it was a relocation issue again.
Jul 02 15:07:46 <allthefoxes>	chooter lives in SFF tho
Jul 02 15:07:46 <vertexoflife>	joyouscacophony what are you talking about?
Jul 02 15:07:47 <joyouscacophony>	So, indirect conflict
Jul 02 15:07:52 <Meneth>	Virtually all the admins are on the West coast, while Victoria is in New York apparently.
Jul 02 15:08:18 <joyouscacophony>	vertexoflife - I was implying that Victoria was let go over issues with Pao
Jul 02 15:08:45 <joyouscacophony>	Probably, Meneth - Stupid policy
Jul 02 15:08:50 <Meneth>	It is.
Jul 02 15:08:56 <allthefoxes>	really? I was under the assumption she traveled to NY when needed, but was located in SF with the rest of the crew
Jul 02 15:08:58 <Meneth>	For one, such a big site needs a timezone spread.
Jul 02 15:09:02 <allthefoxes>	maybe it was the other way around
Jul 02 15:09:13 <Meneth>	No clue. People have mentioned her being in NY tho.
Jul 02 15:09:24 <vertexoflife>	idk I think that's a silly assumption with no knowledge or data
Jul 02 15:09:52 <Meneth>	Referring to joyouscacophony's Pao idea, or my relocation idea? Or both?
Jul 02 15:09:54 <andytuba>	Meneth: i think some of the newer community managers are in other time zones?  don't trust my word for it, though, check the team page
Jul 02 15:09:54 <cwenham>	AMA app just says "Wow, such empty"
Jul 02 15:10:07 <Meneth>	They've laid of people who can't relocate in the past, so that at least seems plausible.
Jul 02 15:10:13 <Meneth>	s/of/off
Jul 02 15:10:14 <gonzobot>	Correction, <Meneth> They've laid off people who can't relocate in the past, so that at least seems plausible.
Jul 02 15:10:40 <Flashynuff>	But on the spot, with 0 communication with the mod teams?
Jul 02 15:11:00 <Flashynuff>	If that was why, they implemented their decision horribly.
Jul 02 15:11:12 <Flashynuff>	Which I suppose is par for the course with reddit.
Jul 02 15:12:16 <joyouscacophony>	It may be a silly assumption vertexoflife, but I'd still be willing to bet it was either conflict of opinion with the pao regime or  a direct consequence of a pao regime policy
Jul 02 15:17:02 <allthefoxes>	https://twitter.com/edfrenkel is pretty pissed at iama

Jul 02 15:18:15 <joyouscacophony>	Rightfully so
Jul 02 15:18:28 <joyouscacophony>	I'm just getting up to speed on this whole drama
Jul 02 15:19:28 <allthefoxes>	Someone might say that Victoria was...
Jul 02 15:19:30 <allthefoxes>	Kung Pao'd

Jul 02 15:19:42 <allthefoxes>	(credit: some dude in ootl)
Jul 02 15:19:56 <Gaget>	reddit let Victoria go?
Jul 02 15:20:01 <Gaget>	What the shit?
Jul 02 15:20:03 <cwenham>	One possibly bad decision—pending more information—has led to another bad decision that we know about. It'd probably be best to simply put the sub into "Self Posts: all" on the spam-filter instead of taking it private.
Jul 02 15:20:04 <Flashynuff>	even if it was a disagreement with Pao, firing her on the spot was an awful move.
Jul 02 15:21:07 <Gaget>	Wow, this Pao must resign might get some actual wind in its sails now.
Jul 02 15:21:11 <Meneth>	Hopefully some sort of explanation comes soon..
Jul 02 15:21:17 <Gaget>	Getting rid of Victoria seems really dumb.
Jul 02 15:22:01 <TitanT>	I presume her contract was made under california law? that's one of the states where you are meant to have things like notice of dismissal etc. right?
Jul 02 15:22:19 <werner__herzog>	Gaget: it already did.
Jul 02 15:22:24 <TitanT>	I heard it was sudden so like idk what's even happening there.
Jul 02 15:22:31 <Flashynuff>	So
Jul 02 15:22:40 <Flashynuff>	Who here is considering making their subs private?
Jul 02 15:22:58 <Gaget>	In protest?
Jul 02 15:23:06 <cwenham>	It would be a third bad decision.
Jul 02 15:23:10 <Meneth>	TitanT: Only if the contract implies it as far as I can tell.
Jul 02 15:23:23 <werner__herzog>	I'm not liking what is happening right now, either. But with the little bit of information we have, I wouldn't be too trigger happy and shut down subreddits. We don't know what the details are.
Jul 02 15:23:34 <cwenham>	We only have karmanaut's side of the story.
Jul 02 15:23:39 <Meneth>	"California’s Labor Code specifies that an employment relationship with no specified duration is presumed to be employment “at-will.” This means, at least in theory, that the employer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause. There are exceptions to the at-will rule created by statute, the courts or public policy."
Jul 02 15:23:44 <werner__herzog>	(It was sudden for IAmA mods, we don't know how sudden it was for her...)
Jul 02 15:23:51 <TitanT>	Oh huh
Jul 02 15:24:02 <TitanT>	I didn't know cali had at-will. That makes more sense then.
Jul 02 15:24:10 <werner__herzog>	But, she probably would have told them...but maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Jul 02 15:24:19 <Meneth>	werner__herzog: We also have one PR guy who had a client who was gonna hold an AMA.
Jul 02 15:24:22 <TitanT>	I was thinking something serious must have gone down, but perhaps not if it was an at-will employment.#
Jul 02 15:24:28 <Meneth>	Who called Victoria and found out she'd just gotten fired.
Jul 02 15:24:39 <Meneth>	So it seems it happened in the last 24 hours or so.
Jul 02 15:25:06 <Meneth>	TitanT: The US is weird. At-will employment isn't really a thing here.
Jul 02 15:25:17 <werner__herzog>	Meneth: ugh...
Jul 02 15:25:36 <Flashynuff>	Mostly I'm pissed at the lack of communication from the current admins. as far as i'm aware they haven't said anything to the numerous modteams who are affected by this change.
Jul 02 15:26:08 <TitanT>	here either
Jul 02 15:27:02 <cwenham>	Taking IAMA or any other large sub private smacks of grandstanding.
Jul 02 15:27:13 <imakuram>	oh nice chooter is talking to us in /r/booksmods about helping us contact ernest cline etc.
Jul 02 15:28:05 <Meneth>	Here in Norway, you pretty much can't fire anyone with less than a month's notice, unless they've clearly broken their employment contract.
Jul 02 15:28:19 <werner__herzog>	New theory: Victoria decided to go out with a bam (since there were relocation issues) and slept with a Jon Hamm. 
Jul 02 15:28:43 <Meneth>	Increases to two months after 5 years employment, and to three months after 10 years employment.
Jul 02 15:29:38 <Meneth>	Works in both directions for good measure.
Jul 02 15:32:36 <x_minus_one>	Victoria seemed nice :(
Jul 02 15:32:54 <x_minus_one>	#ThanksEllenPao
Jul 02 15:34:18 <andytuba>	Meneth: yeah, California is an at-will state. employer can tell you to go away at any time
Jul 02 15:34:29 <Cylon>	werner__herzog, if so then i'm jealous even as at straight dude
Jul 02 15:34:29 <Meneth>	andytuba: Yes. I quoted that above :P
Jul 02 15:34:43 <andytuba>	oh look scrollback
Jul 02 15:35:19 <Cylon>	kn0thing has responded

Jul 02 15:36:23 <Cylon>	basically: none of your business, you'll do fine without her

Jul 02 15:37:29 <JustPassingThrough>	ok admin thx 4 helps
Jul 02 15:37:30 <allthefoxes>	I get that he can't give details about people
Jul 02 15:37:34 <allthefoxes>	but jfc
Jul 02 15:37:43 <allthefoxes>	thats the worst answer he could have given
Jul 02 15:37:59 <JustPassingThrough>	>end of kn0things url is ekp
Jul 02 15:38:02 <Meneth>	I mean if the issue is simply that Victoria can't relocate for example, they could have a transition period of some sort.

Jul 02 15:38:28 <x_minus_one>	Didn't they say in the past though that her job required her to not be in SF?
Jul 02 15:39:38 <x_minus_one>	And that she specifically was an exception?

Jul 02 15:41:13 <Meneth>	One of which was about a brigade, and two about ban evasion.
Jul 02 15:41:15 <x_minus_one>	-ekjp
Jul 02 15:41:28 <Meneth>	An extremely clear-cut brigade.
Jul 02 15:41:50 <Meneth>	As the targetted post had been removed within a second of posting by AutoModerator, and was posted by a throwaway.
Jul 02 15:42:05 <picflute>	So iAmA mods are striking?
Jul 02 15:42:11 <picflute>	Get my popcorn
Jul 02 15:42:17 <Meneth>	So there was no legitimate way to get to it. As far as I can tell, the admins didn't bother to do anything.
Jul 02 15:42:19 <x_minus_one>	Who will be the first to be shadowbanned?
Jul 02 15:42:24 <Meneth>	For all I know they didn't even bother to read my modmail.
Jul 02 15:42:49 <Cylon>	picflute, u r ootl
Jul 02 15:42:55 <x_minus_one>	Reddit won't put up with one of their big PR subs being made private.  Either that or they'll make a poor copy of it and make that a default.
Jul 02 15:43:14 <Cylon>	we here at #modtalk fully support the actions of our administrator overlords
Jul 02 15:43:18 <Cylon>	world without end
Jul 02 15:43:18 <Cylon>	amen
Jul 02 15:43:24 <cwenham>	They have the ability to re-subscribe every current subscriber to a clone sub.
Jul 02 15:43:37 <picflute>	but is it worth it?
Jul 02 15:43:41 <Meneth>	And who the fuck is gonna run the new sub if so?
Jul 02 15:43:43 <MeghanAM>	I wonder if the admins might just... take the sub? It'd be a new twist, but it's their site
Jul 02 15:43:50 <cwenham>	But if they were to do that, they'd probably just wipe the current mod team and take it public again.
Jul 02 15:44:03 <picflute>	ooo that'd be a win for SubredditCancer
Jul 02 15:44:29 <x_minus_one>	I wouldn't be surprised.  I mean, something like /r/nottheonion could easily be booted without causing a stir, but things like iama and askreddit are too big for them to lose
Jul 02 15:45:14 <Cylon>	MeghanAM, they've done it before
Jul 02 15:45:22 <Cylon>	last time AMA shut down
Jul 02 15:45:42 <stopscopiesme>	meneth: were these all sent today, these unanswered messages?
Jul 02 15:45:51 <Meneth>	Nah, over the past few weeks.
Jul 02 15:45:56 <picflute>	But look now, the site is differnt
Jul 02 15:45:58 <joyouscacophony>	Last time AMA shut down, there were calls and begging to get it back up
Jul 02 15:46:03 <joyouscacophony>	Not a full on Admin takeover
Jul 02 15:46:10 <stopscopiesme>	I’ve had similar issues over the past few months getting mails answered
Jul 02 15:46:19 <Cylon>	still, they could just handwave that away
Jul 02 15:46:26 <x_minus_one>	I've had to PM admins lately because modmails were getting ignored
Jul 02 15:46:33 <Cylon>	stopscopiesme, we should start a petition to bring back cupcake
Jul 02 15:46:38 <x_minus_one>	like blatant doxx being posted and they ignored it
Jul 02 15:46:59 <Meneth>	The brigade thing was 2 weeks ago.
Jul 02 15:47:16 <MeghanAM>	cupcake++
Jul 02 15:47:31 <stopscopiesme>	I don’t understand…. there are more community managers than there has ever been, and LESS of my mail is getting answerd
Jul 02 15:47:43 <Meneth>	Hmm. Another message to the admins on the same day did get responded to very quickly.
Jul 02 15:47:51 <Meneth>	And favorably; got a ban evader shadowbanned.
Jul 02 15:47:59 <Meneth>	So that inconsistency makes things even weirder.
Jul 02 15:48:04 <picflute>	Took spork a day to reply to my doxx mail
Jul 02 15:48:37 <picflute>	Noticed that action was taken since the user mentioned I had set to filter in automod and found that they shadowbanned him today
Jul 02 15:48:43 <stopscopiesme>	who usually responds to you guys? I usually only ever see sporkicide, orcrasorm, and liltrixxy
Jul 02 15:48:49 <picflute>	Spork for doxxing
Jul 02 15:48:59 <picflute>	LordVinyl for general issues like Ban evasion
Jul 02 15:49:06 <Meneth>	The ban evasion response was from LordVinyl.
Jul 02 15:49:12 <stopscopiesme>	I think I’ve seen lordvinyl once
Jul 02 15:49:20 <allthefoxes>	i usually get spork
Jul 02 15:49:22 <allthefoxes>	sometimes ocra
Jul 02 15:49:22 <x_minus_one>	I guess they're too busy protecting people who send nudes to random people.
Jul 02 15:49:28 <alienth>	Cylon: last time it shut down we didn't take it. the owner handed it off after discussion.
Jul 02 15:49:30 <joyouscacophony>	usually sporky
Jul 02 15:49:34 <joyouscacophony>	Ocra
Jul 02 15:49:37 <picflute>	Every /r/lol mod gets him when we modmail him. It's crazy.
Jul 02 15:49:39 <joyouscacophony>	And vinyl last on the list
Jul 02 15:49:46 <Meneth>	If every admin interaction was like that ban evasion report, everything would be great.
Jul 02 15:49:52 <Cylon>	ah, misremembered
Jul 02 15:50:01 <x_minus_one>	I thought I was banned from the /r/reddit.com modmail for a while because I didn't get any responses for like 3 months straight
Jul 02 15:50:10 <Meneth>	Often enough though, there's simply never a response, or it takes over a day to get one.
Jul 02 15:50:12 <picflute>	What did you ask?
Jul 02 15:50:17 <Cylon>	x_minus_one, tbh you do really suck
Jul 02 15:50:32 <picflute>	I asked them about reddit policy and 10mins after I made a modtalk thread Deimorz responsded
Jul 02 15:50:39 <x_minus_one>	/r/trashy gets a lot of obvious personal info posted
Jul 02 15:50:59 <picflute>	HAs anyone emaild them before?

Jul 02 15:51:46 <alienth>	picflute: when I was there, we occasionally got emails. it was pretty infrequent, tho. most of the emails were either spam or actual "press" stuff.
Jul 02 15:51:49 <allthefoxes>	It happened
Jul 02 15:51:53 <allthefoxes>	Treebeast level 1000

Jul 02 15:52:40 <picflute>	What i'm curious is with how garbage modmail is should we just email reddit.com

Jul 02 16:11:28 <picflute>	She got PAO'd

Jul 02 16:14:35 <rya>	i do think karmanaut is prob the strongest mod here who will only be taken seriously by the admins

Jul 02 16:15:51 <stopscopiesme>	maybe she was *supposed* to be doing other stuff that wasn’t amas, and wasn’t?

Jul 02 16:16:59 <stopscopiesme>	I can’t imagine a company struggling as hard as reddit justifying paying someone 100k+ a year (my guess of her salary) for just AMA stuff they could pawn off for free to the mods
Jul 02 16:17:19 <Cylon>	that's probably a way too high number
Jul 02 16:17:19 <Meneth>	I wonder how much of a meltdown /r/defaultmods is having.
Jul 02 16:17:30 <Meneth>	They can't be happy.
Jul 02 16:17:38 <x_minus_one>	I always forget about /r/defaultmods.
Jul 02 16:17:38 <stopscopiesme>	I don’t think so. in nyc, 100k is not rich

Jul 02 16:19:03 <Meneth>	Probably a coincidence.
Jul 02 16:19:12 <stopscopiesme>	people are speculating she got reddit in legal trouble by typing stuff she wasn’t supposed to
Jul 02 16:19:12 <Meneth>	There's been plenty of AMA disasters in the past.
Jul 02 16:19:39 <Coffeh>	what happend with the jesse jackson ama? out of the loop

Jul 02 16:20:45 <x316nuts>	it was going to be a disaster no matter what
Jul 02 16:21:01 <stopscopiesme>	heh, at least he hit the front page. uwe boll’s ama was downvoted below the threshold
Jul 02 16:22:57 <x316nuts>	aside from the inherent drama, was something else "said" that was dramatic?
Jul 02 16:23:50 <Meneth>	In regards to Jesse Jackson?
Jul 02 16:23:54 <Meneth>	There was an SRD thread.

Jul 02 16:25:58 <x316nuts>	my departure wasn't even a blip on the radar due to me being a lazy poo
Jul 02 16:26:07 <x316nuts>	i'm okay with this
Jul 02 16:26:40 <stopscopiesme>	I still feel silly I wrote you a pm chiding you for not staying in communication :p
Jul 02 16:26:48 <x316nuts>	AHAHAHAHAHA
Jul 02 16:26:57 <stopscopiesme>	and you didn’t even take the opportunity to respond “I quit two months ago you dumb piece of shit"
Jul 02 16:26:59 <x316nuts>	"stfu what are you in my business for pffft"
Jul 02 16:27:15 <x316nuts>	let the shame and cringe slowly wash over you

Jul 02 16:28:50 <JustPassingThrough>	no
Jul 02 16:28:53 <JustPassingThrough>	he posted something else
Jul 02 16:28:54 <Cylon>	we're on top of things
Jul 02 16:28:57 <JustPassingThrough>	whatever it is, it isnt showing
Jul 02 16:29:03 <Cylon>	oh
Jul 02 16:29:05 <creesch>	Cylon: did you click 
Jul 02 16:29:05 <Cylon>	it is now
Jul 02 16:29:08 <cwenham>	It's been removed or deleted.
Jul 02 16:29:10 <werner__herzog>	thread is locked, btw
Jul 02 16:29:12 <Cylon>	didn't show at first
Jul 02 16:29:38 <werner__herzog>	I approved creesch's comment, cause we're are approving relevant comments to kn0thing
Jul 02 16:29:47 <creesch>	werner__herzog: thanks 
Jul 02 16:29:57 <werner__herzog>	you should be able to see it now Cylon 
Jul 02 16:30:06 <Cylon>	i do
Jul 02 16:30:45 <creesch>	Cylon: it is something I also posted in defaultmods, I think people should be aware of this.
Jul 02 16:31:19 <Cylon>	cabalbots, roll out!
Jul 02 16:31:20 <creesch>	Effectively reddit moderation depends on a third part tool and one of the creators of that tool (me) highly dislikes the fact that this is the case 
Jul 02 16:31:35 <Meneth>	Toolbox <3
Jul 02 16:31:43 <Meneth>	I couldn't moderate without it.
Jul 02 16:31:51 <creesch>	I much rather would have a situation where toolbox was just cool and nifty but in now way necessary for mods to do work efficient. 
Jul 02 16:32:05 <agentlame>	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jul 02 16:32:28 <greenduch>	morning all. how are our pitchforks today? :3
Jul 02 16:32:28 <cordismelum>	that would be nice
Jul 02 16:32:30 <agentlame>	BTW, creesch which one of us will be fixing search?  
Jul 02 16:32:32 <cordismelum>	but when will that happen?
Jul 02 16:32:35 <Cylon>	sharp and polished
Jul 02 16:32:36 <stopscopiesme>	kinda the same thing with RES…. that so many people need a 3rd party extension because vanilla reddit sux
Jul 02 16:32:44 <Meneth>	greenduch: Sharpened and oiled.
Jul 02 16:32:50 <greenduch>	\o/ yay
Jul 02 16:32:50 <gonzobot>	HUAH!
Jul 02 16:32:53 <greenduch>	shuddup gonzobot 
Jul 02 16:33:20 <creesch>	agentlame: sigh... you know who... it is a lot of css work 
Jul 02 16:33:26 <Meneth>	I just can't get past that the admins didn't bother to write up a message to the affected subreddits.
Jul 02 16:33:34 <Meneth>	That's like... PR 101.
Jul 02 16:34:20 <Meneth>	It wouldn't even have to say much. "Victoria no longer works for us. We can't talk about the reasons why. kn0thing will try to handle her duties while we work things out."
Jul 02 16:34:20 <Cylon>	yeah meneth they just fired their only semi-pr person
Jul 02 16:34:40 <Meneth>	If something like that had been sent to all the affected subs within a few minutes of the firing, I think the mods would be a lot less up in arms.
Jul 02 16:34:58 <Flashynuff>	Most likely, yeah.
Jul 02 16:35:34 <Meneth>	Reddit could probably hire a 15 year old to communicate better than they do today.
Jul 02 16:35:50 <Meneth>	...Jaden Smith would probably commmunicate better on reddit's behalf than reddit does today.
Jul 02 16:35:58 <Meneth>	And would have the advantage of being hilarious.
Jul 02 16:36:28 <kerovon>	r/science is currently scrambling to attempt to salavage a massive AMA we almost had finalized
Jul 02 16:36:44 <kerovon>	but we are having trouble getting responses.
Jul 02 16:36:57 <Meneth>	What a mess.
Jul 02 16:37:46 <MeghanAM>	How can admins be real if reddit isn't real: the blog post
Jul 02 16:42:34 <Meneth>	Anyone remember the Magic: The Gathering rapist guy? Apparently he got a 35 year ban from professional Magic :D
Jul 02 16:42:48 <cordismelum>	yay
Jul 02 16:42:59 <cordismelum>	35 years isn't long enough
Jul 02 16:44:32 <x_minus_one>	Anyone know where to get a really cheap lightning cable?  Don't care about the quality, it's for something where I work
Jul 02 16:44:37 <TheAppleFreak>	Amazon
Jul 02 16:44:47 <kerovon>	r/science is kill.
Jul 02 16:44:56 <rya>	lol 
Jul 02 16:45:03 <rya>	dey r having problems too i hear
Jul 02 16:45:15 <x_minus_one>	oooh
Jul 02 16:45:23 <rya>	i wonder if dey will take some action
Jul 02 16:45:36 <rya>	r/science has a lot of mods doe
Jul 02 16:46:03 <kerovon>	Most of our mods are just comment mods.
Jul 02 16:46:10 <x_minus_one>	I wish there was a way to sort amazon by low to high, price + shipping
Jul 02 16:46:28 ---	ButtServ gives channel half-operator status to krispykrackers
Jul 02 16:46:39 <TheAppleFreak>	isn't there already a way? I swear they have a "sort by price" option
Jul 02 16:46:56 <x_minus_one>	yeah, but it doesn't include shipping
Jul 02 16:47:12 <x_minus_one>	so all the $0.01 (plus $15.00 shipping) ones show up first
Jul 02 16:47:16 <cwenham>	Hello, Krispy.
Jul 02 16:47:26 <krispykrackers>	hey
Jul 02 16:47:33 <krispykrackers>	not sur what I’m doing here tbh
Jul 02 16:47:36 <cwenham>	Interesting times.
Jul 02 16:47:40 <krispykrackers>	but if anyone has questions or whatever, I’d love to hear it
Jul 02 16:47:44 <x_minus_one>	krispy always shows up when shit goes down
Jul 02 16:47:47 <TheAppleFreak>	what is love
Jul 02 16:48:19 <krispykrackers>	baby, don’t hurt me?
Jul 02 16:48:33 <cwenham>	We have only one side of today's story. We're wondering if there's something else we ought to know :-)
Jul 02 16:48:54 <krispykrackers>	regarding victoria specifically?
Jul 02 16:48:59 <cwenham>	Yup.
Jul 02 16:49:17 <krispykrackers>	so
Jul 02 16:49:31 <krispykrackers>	I woke up this morning took a shower, and checked my email while walking to work
Jul 02 16:49:41 <rya>	hehe
Jul 02 16:49:42 <krispykrackers>	second from the top was “Thank you, Victoria"
Jul 02 16:49:52 <krispykrackers>	and that’s how I found out
Jul 02 16:49:55 <rya>	what happened krispykrackers 
Jul 02 16:50:03 <rya>	y did dey fire victoria ?
Jul 02 16:50:06 <rya>	or lay off
Jul 02 16:50:12 <krispykrackers>	I assume maybe two people here know the real reason, Alexis and Ellen
Jul 02 16:50:26 <krispykrackers>	I don’t know. I’m assuming terminated. I can’t imagine she would leave, she loved working here.
Jul 02 16:50:29 <rya>	oh
Jul 02 16:50:44 <x_minus_one>	That's sad. :(
Jul 02 16:50:47 <greenduch>	yeah it is
Jul 02 16:50:49 <rya>	she did her job well right krispykrackers 
Jul 02 16:50:59 <rya>	der shud never be a reason to terminate
Jul 02 16:51:03 <rya>	this is bs
Jul 02 16:51:13 <Meneth>	I mean, there might've been one. Chances are we'll never know.
Jul 02 16:51:26 <cwenham>	There's a bit of an "let's do an Atlas Shrugged" mood circulating around here. Perhaps Alexis and Ellen can step in before it goes to a strike or something.
Jul 02 16:51:38 <x_minus_one>	I'm assuming Ms. Pao isn't going to pull a yishan and post about it.
Jul 02 16:51:39 <Meneth>	The real issue in my opinion is that the admins didn't bother to tell the affected subs *anything*.
Jul 02 16:51:49 <EvilNight>	If she was terminated because Jesse Jackson's AMA went down in flames I will be taking issue with that.
Jul 02 16:51:51 <Nesquik>	^
Jul 02 16:51:56 <rya>	wat
Jul 02 16:52:04 <allthefoxes>	I would for sure
Jul 02 16:52:07 <allthefoxes>	but we dont know
Jul 02 16:52:08 <greenduch>	im sure that was not why
Jul 02 16:52:10 <allthefoxes>	we never really will
Jul 02 16:52:15 <EvilNight>	one of the more popular theories but frankly no one knows why
Jul 02 16:52:15 <rya>	that was just one ama i guess and i doubt it wud be the reason
Jul 02 16:52:24 <Meneth>	Of course. It's possible she was laid off for a terrible reason. It is possible it was for a good reason. It is possible it was for a mediocre reason.
Jul 02 16:52:25 <greenduch>	a shit ton of reddit employees have been let go lately
Jul 02 16:52:26 <rya>	der have been amas previously which have had problems
Jul 02 16:52:31 <greenduch>	if you notice the team page
Jul 02 16:52:33 <Nesquik>	the effected subs really should have been given more notice so they could have time to plan and arrange
Jul 02 16:52:35 <x_minus_one>	Honestly, I think even hearing a "we actually do care about y'all" from Ellen would make people feel better.  It always seems like she's not involved with the site, which probably doesn't help the whole "lel chairman pao" reputation.
Jul 02 16:52:42 <Meneth>	The only thing we know for sure, is that the admins didn't bother to tell the affected subs.
Jul 02 16:52:54 <greenduch>	basically all the old timers are gone at this point, except for krispykrackers. and maybe deimorz because he's in canada and they cant force him to move to SF
Jul 02 16:53:02 <Meneth>	Instead, IAMA learned from some PR guy representing some person who was gonna hold an AMA.
Jul 02 16:53:13 <greenduch>	wow
Jul 02 16:53:15 <Meneth>	And most everyone else learned from IAMA closing.
Jul 02 16:53:25 <krispykrackers>	she was great at her job
Jul 02 16:53:30 <x_minus_one>	They would be in so much trouble without deimorz, honestly.
Jul 02 16:53:34 <rya>	right ?
Jul 02 16:53:36 <allthefoxes>	cwenham, honestly, yeah, and I can understand it. I'm a bit mixed, but when people who literally spend so much of thier free time to make this site better just get repeatedly shit on by the people who run this site.
Jul 02 16:53:43 <rya>	so i dont see the reason at all krispykrackers 
Jul 02 16:53:57 <kerovon>	2 defaults have already gone private over the lack of communication.  
Jul 02 16:54:03 <TheAppleFreak>	what
Jul 02 16:54:07 <allthefoxes>	And its worse because I bet a lot of people at reddit want reddit to well too, ffs
Jul 02 16:54:11 <cwenham>	Which is the other default?
Jul 02 16:54:12 <greenduch>	funny how management seems to show a complete lack of respect for their employees as well as for reddit mods. that they would leave AMA mods, basically their flagship subreddit, hanging like that is fucking bizarre
Jul 02 16:54:15 <rya>	the current administration seems so distant from the sub krispykrackers.. its like they dont care anymore
Jul 02 16:54:23 <rya>	*site
Jul 02 16:54:31 <allthefoxes>	But thats the thing
Jul 02 16:54:33 <kerovon>	r/science went private about 5 minutes ago.
Jul 02 16:54:38 <allthefoxes>	I bet $1000000 dollars that they do care
Jul 02 16:54:38 <TheAppleFreak>	shit
Jul 02 16:54:43 <EvilNight>	ho boy
Jul 02 16:54:47 <allthefoxes>	they just arent showing it the right fucking way
Jul 02 16:54:52 <rya>	yea right
Jul 02 16:55:10 <cwenham>	That's a kick in the teeth.
Jul 02 16:55:25 <allthefoxes>	I feel like ive been kicked in the teeth too by all this shit lately
Jul 02 16:55:31 <krispykrackers>	tell me about it
Jul 02 16:55:36 <allthefoxes>	Right
Jul 02 16:55:42 <allthefoxes>	so thats what upsets me
Jul 02 16:55:46 <allthefoxes>	we are getting kicked
Jul 02 16:55:49 <allthefoxes>	you are getting kicked
Jul 02 16:55:52 <x_minus_one>	I'm pretty sure if another well-liked admin gets the boot, shit's gonna go down
Jul 02 16:55:58 <Meneth>	Yeah. From my perspective communication is reddit's real problem.
Jul 02 16:56:03 <allthefoxes>	Everyone is getting kicked in the face BY REDDIT because REDDIT cant get it together
Jul 02 16:56:06 <Meneth>	Not imaginary conspiracies. Actual communication.
Jul 02 16:56:11 <cwenham>	It is presently going down. 2 defaults already.
Jul 02 16:56:32 <allthefoxes>	I left a comment about it here
Jul 02 16:56:32 <Meneth>	When I report an obvious, clear-cut brigade to the admins, I expect to actually get a response of *some* sort.
Jul 02 16:56:33 <allthefoxes>	https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods/comments/3bw94t/riama_goes_private_after_victoria_uchooter_is_let/csq9ytt
Jul 02 16:56:39 <allthefoxes>	Sorry to the non defualt mods scrubs
Jul 02 16:56:41 <rya>	is it cause the admins dont have a personal connection with the site anymore krispykrackers ? like before the admins used to be more u kno.. friendly and liked people and more vocal
Jul 02 16:56:47 <rya>	these days its all pao
Jul 02 16:56:52 <Meneth>	And when a reddit decision significantly disrupts major subs, those need to be told *something*.
Jul 02 16:56:53 <allthefoxes>	Pao right in the kisser
Jul 02 16:56:57 <rya>	or people mysteriously comming and leaving
Jul 02 16:56:59 <x_minus_one>	Pao! Right in the nuts.
Jul 02 16:57:03 <x_minus_one>	crap, you beat me allthefoxes 
Jul 02 16:57:04 <weeedbot>	(⊙︿⊙)  crap ass 
Jul 02 16:58:05 <allthefoxes>	This just all sucks
Jul 02 16:58:07 <agentlame>	stopscopiesme: you're my hero https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3bvkf0/stop_throwing_beer_cans_on_my_lawn_while_im/csqaa0b?context=3
Jul 02 16:58:11 <rya>	do u think there will be a blog post about this krispykrackers ?
Jul 02 16:58:17 <allthefoxes>	there wont be
Jul 02 16:58:18 <krispykrackers>	I don’t know
Jul 02 16:58:21 <allthefoxes>	theres nothing to say
Jul 02 16:58:22 <rya>	oh
Jul 02 16:58:25 <allthefoxes>	"we fired someone"
Jul 02 16:58:26 <krispykrackers>	I don’t think it’s /r/blog worthy
Jul 02 16:58:27 <rya>	fack
Jul 02 16:58:28 <stopscopiesme>	who the fuck is even in charge of reddit? I’ve never been able to figure it out. who is actually responsible for major decisions? kn0thing? ellen pao? the board?
Jul 02 16:58:33 <rya>	well thats too bad
Jul 02 16:58:43 <allthefoxes>	stopscopiesme, reddits board is Ellen, Alexis, and some dude from Advanced
Jul 02 16:58:47 <rya>	well it is true i guess.. reddit has fired people before
Jul 02 16:58:50 <Meneth>	krispykrackers: Two defaults going private is a pretty big deal.
Jul 02 16:58:56 <krispykrackers>	yeah
Jul 02 16:58:59 <krispykrackers>	I’m in crisis mode
Jul 02 16:59:00 <EvilNight>	and rather unprecedented tbh
Jul 02 16:59:09 <creesch>	werner__herzog: Now I am wondering if I got replies to my comment, locked threads are pretty awesome :P
Jul 02 16:59:12 <krispykrackers>	I have no idea wtf to do, to be perfectly crystal clear with you guys
Jul 02 16:59:17 <allthefoxes>	Talk to Alexis
Jul 02 16:59:18 <cwenham>	There's a lot of Kremlin-Watching going on.
Jul 02 16:59:19 <allthefoxes>	Talk to ellen
Jul 02 16:59:23 <allthefoxes>	Tell them what we are saying
Jul 02 16:59:27 <Meneth>	krispykrackers: Sounds like you know just about as much as we do.
Jul 02 16:59:28 <rya>	krispykrackers u r a community manager right? i have never understood what you do now lol
Jul 02 16:59:30 <EvilNight>	look we could all go muntiy mode and shut down most subs in private mode for a day in protest... but to what end, what good would it do
Jul 02 16:59:32 <stopscopiesme>	is there anyone we should be complaining to? I feel like the admins who actually talk to us (like you) have very limited authority
Jul 02 16:59:38 <allthefoxes>	but thats the thing
Jul 02 16:59:39 <allthefoxes>	at reddit
Jul 02 16:59:45 <EvilNight>	does anyone expect them to care or do anything other than boot all the mod teams?
Jul 02 16:59:49 <agentlame>	Try none at all.
Jul 02 16:59:50 <allthefoxes>	They act like a company of 2000 people
Jul 02 16:59:54 <allthefoxes>	when they have a team of 60
Jul 02 16:59:58 <allthefoxes>	They split up these tasks
Jul 02 17:00:04 <allthefoxes>	and every team just does their fucking thing
Jul 02 17:00:13 <stopscopiesme>	also agentlame, I called out go1dfish on his alt. no zinger though
Jul 02 17:00:22 <allthefoxes>	Like
Jul 02 17:00:28 <Meneth>	I mean, compartmentalization is important. You simply don't have the time to let everyone know everything.
Jul 02 17:00:32 <allthefoxes>	There is no reason why every admin can't be involved in /r/beta
Jul 02 17:00:34 <creesch>	allthefoxes: well if you have a shitton of halfway finished or abandoned projects that are standing in the way I can understand you sort of have issues focussing 
Jul 02 17:00:37 <andytuba>	allthefoxes: wait what
Jul 02 17:00:37 <werner__herzog>	creesch, I'm getting orange reds and then they disappear again, I have to hunt my replies down, too :D
Jul 02 17:00:41 <agentlame>	goldfish could have been the meta news of the day.
Jul 02 17:00:46 <andytuba>	there are plenty of reasons
Jul 02 17:00:51 <allthefoxes>	right
Jul 02 17:00:53 <agentlame>	Thanks based admins for burning reddit!
Jul 02 17:00:55 <Meneth>	I work for Paradox Interactive for example, but I have literally no idea what any of their unannounced games are.
Jul 02 17:00:57 <allthefoxes>	im not saying people can't have tasks
Jul 02 17:00:59 <creesch>	werner__herzog: can you check my comment pretty please? :D
Jul 02 17:01:03 <rya>	waaaaaa
Jul 02 17:01:14 <allthefoxes>	im saying that, i.e. search: The CMs were basically not involved?
Jul 02 17:01:17 <rya>	wat u doin agentlame ? looking at the fire ?
Jul 02 17:01:20 <werner__herzog>	no replies 
Jul 02 17:01:25 <allthefoxes>	Why would community managers not be involed with /r/beta
Jul 02 17:01:41 <allthefoxes>	Why wouldnt our feedback about the new search not get talked about, changed, and the search be still in beta
Jul 02 17:01:46 <allthefoxes>	communication meltdown
Jul 02 17:01:47 <agentlame>	rya: I'm wondering why the admins break mod tools and then ignore the feedback.
Jul 02 17:01:57 <agentlame>	But that's now small fries.
Jul 02 17:01:59 <allthefoxes>	Thats all reddit really needs to fix, to make things start to get better
Jul 02 17:02:01 <krispykrackers>	We know what’s happening in /r/beta. Unfortunately we (meaning the communtiy team as well as the community) don’t have final say in what gets implemented. 
Jul 02 17:02:06 <allthefoxes>	But you should
Jul 02 17:02:07 <rya>	oh u know the reason right agentlame
Jul 02 17:02:07 <allthefoxes>	is what I mean
Jul 02 17:02:11 <krispykrackers>	well
Jul 02 17:02:11 <creesch>	When a majority of the people that run your site rely on a third party extension and you focus on search and make it even worse for the same group something is clearly wrong. 
Jul 02 17:02:15 <allthefoxes>	theres no reason you shouldnt, in my eyes at least
Jul 02 17:02:29 <allthefoxes>	i obviously dont work there, I cant say anything like I know it to be true
Jul 02 17:02:46 <allthefoxes>	and im sorry if I am, bad habit maybe
Jul 02 17:03:04 <greenduch>	btw, to mod teams that have gone private, solidarity, and best of luck to yall. 
Jul 02 17:03:08 <rya>	oh man this is an important conversations happening here
Jul 02 17:03:14 <rya>	its bound to be leaked
Jul 02 17:03:16 <krispykrackers>	I tend to agree, but on the other hand, they feel that they should be able to implement changes for the health of the site and the site’s growth outside of community opinion. They have a certain point - they should be allowed to experiment and try new things. Unfortunately they don’t always mesh with people like us - the long term, mod-heavy, old-school community
Jul 02 17:03:19 <allthefoxes>	But I just dont understand why a team that manages a community cant have a say in relaying what users are saying to devs and engineers
Jul 02 17:03:21 <agentlame>	What all subs are private?
Jul 02 17:03:21 <creesch>	greenduch: have other defaults gone private that I missed? 
Jul 02 17:03:23 <krispykrackers>	they think about new users and logged out users and things like that
Jul 02 17:03:24 <EvilNight>	What I see is a 1990s publishing mentality being applied to a 2010s social media platform - aka a cluster of fucks most high
Jul 02 17:03:24 <rya>	HI MOM HI DAD
Jul 02 17:03:43 <greenduch>	i believe iama and rscience
Jul 02 17:03:43 <allthefoxes>	krispykrackers, thats fiar, but a complete search overhaul could be argued to be far from minor
Jul 02 17:03:47 <creesch>	krispykrackers: for the health of the website wouldn't you agree that the people that maintain that health had the proper tools? 
Jul 02 17:03:48 <greenduch>	not sure about others
Jul 02 17:04:02 <creesch>	Obviously you don't need to answer that 
Jul 02 17:04:04 <allthefoxes>	And honestly, this is a community website
Jul 02 17:04:06 <rya>	heh let krispy reply to one comment atleast
Jul 02 17:04:08 <greenduch>	also folks please try to be gentle to kk in here. 
Jul 02 17:04:14 <allthefoxes>	i do love you kk
Jul 02 17:04:17 <x_minus_one>	wait, that search page made it out of beta?
Jul 02 17:04:18 <allthefoxes>	and i know this is not easy on you
Jul 02 17:04:27 <allthefoxes>	<3 so much, not trying to be hard on you
Jul 02 17:04:29 <allthefoxes>	just venting a bit
Jul 02 17:04:35 <creesch>	I mean, you are here trying to talk to us while the people that actually decide these things are silent. 
Jul 02 17:04:42 <rya>	well she cant do much foxes
Jul 02 17:04:44 <EvilNight>	exactly
Jul 02 17:04:47 <creesch>	So it isn't even fair for me to ask 
Jul 02 17:04:48 <greenduch>	we love you kk im sorry you have to deal with our bitching <3 though i think its pretty understable that people are upset, it sucks youre the person who has to deal with it <3
Jul 02 17:05:00 <rya>	krispykrackers ^
Jul 02 17:05:03 <x_minus_one>	and we appreciate you actually talking to us <3
Jul 02 17:05:05 <allthefoxes>	It just doesn't make sense to me, that a community website that is ltierally based around the ideas of COMMUNITY would make changes without at least CONSIDERING that communty
Jul 02 17:05:17 <greenduch>	i was intentionally not pinging her, rya , so she wasnt getting pinged every line :p
Jul 02 17:05:25 <rya>	ah
Jul 02 17:05:26 <creesch>	greenduch: pls
Jul 02 17:05:26 <allthefoxes>	I get that maybe you want to make changes and shit, that arent to heavily involved
Jul 02 17:05:33 <creesch>	oh 
Jul 02 17:05:35 <allthefoxes>	but,the community should be at least considered
Jul 02 17:05:36 <allthefoxes>	to me
Jul 02 17:05:36 <creesch>	You answered
Jul 02 17:05:43 <allthefoxes>	anyways, I don't like bitching this much, I need a drink
Jul 02 17:05:52 <allthefoxes>	what am i talking about i love bitching about everything
Jul 02 17:05:57 <EvilNight>	aye, this does call for a drink, or three
Jul 02 17:06:01 <rya>	asking for admins feedback agentlame ?
Jul 02 17:06:01 <allthefoxes>	im a reddit mod after all
Jul 02 17:06:03 <rya>	agentlame pls
Jul 02 17:06:04 <allthefoxes>	ayyyyyy
Jul 02 17:06:14 <EvilNight>	if we were in a pub I'd buy the first round
Jul 02 17:06:22 <agentlame>	rya: according to krispy I didn't. :p
Jul 02 17:06:22 <cwenham>	I don't think any of us would mind if KK "leaked" this #modtalk conversation to Alexis and Ellen. 
Jul 02 17:06:34 <rya>	hehe
Jul 02 17:06:35 <rya>	gud gud
Jul 02 17:06:43 <rya>	i m afraid of how things are going
Jul 02 17:07:25 <rya>	well victoria is gone
Jul 02 17:07:29 <krispykrackers>	I mean, I’m a community manager. I think I should have final say in EVERYTHING that happens to reddit because I listen to you guys and you guys are all smarter than I am. Unfortunately we’re not a small startup anymore and we’re restricted to teams now. The community team, outside of deimorz and lately weffey, doesn’t implement features, and really never implement UI features, mostly admin/mod tools and spam tools and things 
Jul 02 17:07:29 <krispykrackers>	like that.
Jul 02 17:07:51 <rya>	ah
Jul 02 17:08:05 <stopscopiesme>	is there anything we could do to pressure change?
Jul 02 17:08:34 <Meneth>	" mostly admin/mod tools and spam tools" That's what we need a lot more of, tho.
Jul 02 17:08:35 <rya>	well i appreciate all you have done krispykrackers .. I get the company is no more the old one and its pretty cut off i guess
Jul 02 17:08:40 <agentlame>	I guess that depends on how this little 'private default strike'\ goes.
Jul 02 17:08:50 <krispykrackers>	give me 5 minutes
Jul 02 17:08:53 <krispykrackers>	phone call
Jul 02 17:08:53 <Meneth>	Like creesch, every important sub shouldn't have to rely on a 3rd party extension in order to moderate properly.
Jul 02 17:08:57 <x_minus_one>	oh boy
Jul 02 17:09:02 <Meneth>	s/creesch/creesch said
Jul 02 17:09:02 <gonzobot>	Correction, <Meneth> Like creesch said, every important sub shouldn't have to rely on a 3rd party extension in order to moderate properly.
Jul 02 17:09:34 <creesch>	https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq9aou?context=3 
Jul 02 17:09:56 <creesch>	toolbox has 6000 users, which is a huge amount of the active mods...
Jul 02 17:10:09 <creesch>	it never ever gotten this popular 
Jul 02 17:10:15 <creesch>	*should 
Jul 02 17:10:34 <agentlame>	Well...
Jul 02 17:10:43 <creesch>	The only reason it did is because it fills a huge gap in needed tools 
Jul 02 17:10:44 <agentlame>	It does have a queue ketteh also.
Jul 02 17:10:56 <EvilNight>	reddit's community wields the total power here, but the crux of a protest of any kind is making it constructuve instead of destructive
Jul 02 17:11:04 <rya>	u kno... i think kn0thing has lost his sight of what this site was
Jul 02 17:11:05 <creesch>	and frankly, sometimes it even does so poorly because we can't substitute server side stuff. 
Jul 02 17:11:08 <agentlame>	That's easily worth 10k installs.
Jul 02 17:11:14 <lucastars>	just don't go go1dfish protest 
Jul 02 17:11:17 <Meneth>	EvilNight: Reddit doesn't really have the tools for that.
Jul 02 17:11:19 <creesch>	agentlame: kitteh totally is 
Jul 02 17:11:35 <EvilNight>	yeah, Iv'e heard that excuse before
Jul 02 17:11:38 <Meneth>	And strikes can be incredibly effective in real life.
Jul 02 17:11:41 <Flashynuff>	and that's what it comes back to, isn't it, meneth: lack of tools
Jul 02 17:11:43 <lucastars>	if you can even call what he did and/or is doing a protest
Jul 02 17:11:48 <EvilNight>	grow balls, write code, a $50m warchest can pay for a lot of top programming talent
Jul 02 17:11:49 <Meneth>	Norwegian society is basically built on the threat of strikes.
Jul 02 17:12:46 <allthefoxes>	krispykrackers, but..thats what I still dont understand..I said it in defaultmods. Yeah, you arent a little startup..but you are a group of SIXTY people. Thats nothing. Absolutely nothing. Different then 20? Yes, but reddit needs to figure out how it wants to be run. Does it want to be run like it has 6000 emplyees, or 60
Jul 02 17:12:55 <allthefoxes>	its been acting like it has 6000, and its not working
Jul 02 17:13:03 <allthefoxes>	at least, from a community perspective
Jul 02 17:13:05 <krispykrackers>	yes
Jul 02 17:13:06 <EvilNight>	I've been a broken record for seven years... all the problems we see can be solved by coding new features into the website, most of them are in fact trivial solutions other sites perfected long ago... yet this never happens
Jul 02 17:13:10 <allthefoxes>	maybe from a numbers perspective, it is! 
Jul 02 17:13:20 <krispykrackers>	I can walk over to tdohz’s desk and say “hey I think this feature is a bad idea, check out this thread"
Jul 02 17:13:31 <krispykrackers>	but ultimately I am not their boss and don’t have final say in what gets done
Jul 02 17:13:33 <krispykrackers>	on her team
Jul 02 17:13:36 <allthefoxes>	But then what you say gets thrown out
Jul 02 17:13:37 <allthefoxes>	right
Jul 02 17:13:42 <allthefoxes>	and that really sucks
Jul 02 17:13:43 <rya>	well i doubt anything we say here does anything allthefoxes .. she doesnt really have to power to do anything and the peson who does that wont listen to anyone
Jul 02 17:13:51 <allthefoxes>	Im not saying she does
Jul 02 17:13:57 <EvilNight>	the ideas are out there krispy, god knows theory of reddit alone has created stacks of scijourno-level papers on how to make things better
Jul 02 17:14:00 <allthefoxes>	I dont expect kk to do a damn thing
Jul 02 17:14:01 <rya>	then what r u saying
Jul 02 17:14:07 <EvilNight>	how do we get them to listen to that and take action, that's the rub
Jul 02 17:14:09 <rya>	and y r u saying it
Jul 02 17:14:10 <allthefoxes>	I'm just explaining what I see
Jul 02 17:14:17 <allthefoxes>	so maybe there is some different perspective
Jul 02 17:14:24 <rya>	different what ?
Jul 02 17:14:33 <Meneth>	A great example of reddit's failure to communicate: /r/snoogaming.
Jul 02 17:14:37 <rya>	i dont get it
Jul 02 17:14:46 <Meneth>	Finally it looked like we were actually getting heard. And then the admin in charge of that got laid off.
Jul 02 17:14:54 <Meneth>	And no one picked up the slack.
Jul 02 17:14:55 <allthefoxes>	Obv kk is not thdoz's boss, but if kk has to go so far to say "Hey, people are bringing this up, its pretty serious" and it still gets thrown out, something is clearly wrong
Jul 02 17:15:05 <rya>	oh they know
Jul 02 17:15:06 <krispykrackers>	it’s not that it gets thrown out
Jul 02 17:15:10 <krispykrackers>	they just view it differently
Jul 02 17:15:19 <allthefoxes>	And look what its done
Jul 02 17:15:21 <allthefoxes>	hahaha
Jul 02 17:15:29 <rya>	like how krispykrackers ?
Jul 02 17:15:42 <allthefoxes>	I'll pen it down in my "book of reddit fuck ups, Vol. 19"
Jul 02 17:15:55 <rya>	u shud post in r/tifu
Jul 02 17:15:58 <allthefoxes>	lol
Jul 02 17:16:01 <rya>	i wonder if kn0thing will post one
Jul 02 17:16:08 <rya>	tifu by firing victoria
Jul 02 17:16:09 <allthefoxes>	TIFU by laying off Victoria
Jul 02 17:16:11 <rya>	hehe
Jul 02 17:16:15 <Nesquik>	it would break the sub
Jul 02 17:16:15 <rya>	i will approve it 
Jul 02 17:16:17 <rya>	haha
Jul 02 17:16:25 <Nesquik>	top of all in minutes
Jul 02 17:16:35 <Nesquik>	more popular then jenny 
Jul 02 17:17:02 <werner__herzog>	> tifu by firing victoria
Jul 02 17:17:04 <werner__herzog>	nice!
Jul 02 17:17:11 <allthefoxes>	But, like, what I mean is just that..as a team, the team could have these inpouts. Youre not the boss, clearly..but if something gets said, it should be heard. And if enough users are saying it, they dont see it that way, you go up to them, they still don't see it, then somehting is ust going wrong
Jul 02 17:17:17 <krispykrackers>	rya, they look at data and bounce rates and page depths and stuff
Jul 02 17:17:29 <krispykrackers>	X feature cause Y growth
Jul 02 17:17:30 <krispykrackers>	etc
Jul 02 17:17:33 <rya>	oh
Jul 02 17:17:35 <allthefoxes>	thats not "seeing things differently", thats "ignoring the community" when things cause this much trouble
Jul 02 17:17:35 <rya>	the numbes
Jul 02 17:17:41 <rya>	well thats great
Jul 02 17:17:47 <allthefoxes>	And ofc they dont really want to do somehting for the community
Jul 02 17:17:49 <allthefoxes>	I can understand that
Jul 02 17:17:54 <rya>	as i was saying
Jul 02 17:17:59 <allthefoxes>	but, like, its a website founded on the principle of communities
Jul 02 17:18:06 <rya>	kn0thin has lost sight of what this sub is i guess
Jul 02 17:18:07 <rya>	lol
Jul 02 17:18:12 <greenduch>	thats fine, let them look at the bounce rate when IAMA and rscience have their doors closed :p
Jul 02 17:18:15 <allthefoxes>	kek
Jul 02 17:18:20 <rya>	hehe
Jul 02 17:18:28 <rya>	i guess numbers will start speaking
Jul 02 17:18:38 <greenduch>	kn0thin hasnt had on-the-ground reddit experience in like a fucking decade
Jul 02 17:18:51 <allthefoxes>	but thats just the thing for me. If the community says something, through our lips, or through kks lips. 
Jul 02 17:18:59 <Meneth>	Pissing off all the big mods is always a great idea.
Jul 02 17:19:01 <greenduch>	he's an executive chairman with his head in the clouds, he is disconnected from how reddit aactually functions
Jul 02 17:19:06 <Meneth>	What could possibly go wrong.
Jul 02 17:19:07 <allthefoxes>	It needs to be taken into a deeper look
Jul 02 17:19:07 <stopscopiesme>	krispykrackers: I’m in crisis mode
Jul 02 17:19:10 <rya>	well dey had admins who actually cared before
Jul 02 17:19:13 <teaearlgraycold>	ELI5 might shut down
Jul 02 17:19:16 <allthefoxes>	good
Jul 02 17:19:18 <rya>	now all dat is left is krispy and deimorz
Jul 02 17:19:21 <allthefoxes>	This gets better by the minute
Jul 02 17:19:26 <stopscopiesme>	oopss sorry for the ping
Jul 02 17:19:47 <greenduch>	props to ELI5, frankly
Jul 02 17:19:48 <EvilNight>	frankly krispky, I'm used to being able to walk into my boss' office and tell him off in a rant... this is why I work at smaller startups mostly, the boss isn't such an egomaniac that he can't handle criticism
Jul 02 17:19:55 <allthefoxes>	kk can't do a damn thing about this, but kn0thing and the chairman can. No one excpects victria to come back (anyone who does is a retard)
Jul 02 17:19:56 <EvilNight>	I don't know how you tolerate it, I've never been able to :P
Jul 02 17:20:03 <zaikanekochan>	politics is debating it, as well.
Jul 02 17:20:03 <Meneth>	Heh, circlejerk has gone private. Not really a surprise.
Jul 02 17:20:04 <The1RGood>	I know drunken_economist cares
Jul 02 17:20:11 <Meneth>	"If you have any concerns, please contact circlejerk at: berniesandersforpresident@reddit.com"
Jul 02 17:20:12 <allthefoxes>	but reddit needs to step up the bar for communication
Jul 02 17:20:13 <EvilNight>	lol
Jul 02 17:20:14 <kwiztas>	krispykrackers, do you think more subs should join science.
Jul 02 17:20:17 <agentlame>	If I could get once open answer form the admins, I think it would be if kn0thing plays a fiddle in the office.  krispykrackers, any insight?
Jul 02 17:20:23 <rya>	well yea but not like the previous admins The1RGood 
Jul 02 17:20:23 <agentlame>	one*
Jul 02 17:20:24 <allthefoxes>	no cause that would make her job a nightmare kwiztas 
Jul 02 17:20:25 <joyouscacophony>	Meneth: I think they've been private for a week now?
Jul 02 17:20:26 <allthefoxes>	it already is
Jul 02 17:20:27 <allthefoxes>	^^
Jul 02 17:20:35 <krispykrackers>	no, I don’t know what privatizing defaults is supposed to do other than punish the subscribers
Jul 02 17:20:38 <Meneth>	joyouscacophony: Well, they've updated their description at least.
Jul 02 17:20:47 <krispykrackers>	I can see /r/IAmA, they are literally unhinged
Jul 02 17:20:49 <allthefoxes>	Well, it will certainly change those numbers
Jul 02 17:20:51 <rya>	i guess u r right kk
Jul 02 17:20:53 <joyouscacophony>	Good on them, really
Jul 02 17:21:03 <EvilNight>	well, if all defaults went private for a day, linking to an open letter to reddit, shit would go down for sure
Jul 02 17:21:07 <The1RGood>	I think privitizing defaults is supposed to "get subs on board" or something
Jul 02 17:21:10 <allthefoxes>	if they wont listen to community, maybe numbers could get someone to do SOMETHING about this communication idea
Jul 02 17:21:11 <The1RGood>	kinda like the wikipedia blackout
Jul 02 17:21:15 <EvilNight>	but that's more likely to be destructive than constructive
Jul 02 17:21:19 <The1RGood>	back when that happened
Jul 02 17:21:21 <EvilNight>	this shouldn't require a public protest
Jul 02 17:21:26 <Meneth>	krispykrackers: Reddit did their thing for SOPA a few years ago.
Jul 02 17:21:30 <EvilNight>	the fact that there are a fuckload of concerned mods here should be enough
Jul 02 17:21:35 <allthefoxes>	I get the facebook might want to look at numbers rather than people
Jul 02 17:21:36 <krispykrackers>	that was politically based
Jul 02 17:21:40 <allthefoxes>	but reddit is a site about community
Jul 02 17:21:41 <joyouscacophony>	If more defaults went private to drive an admin response... I don't know
Jul 02 17:21:58 <greenduch>	i think shutting down things is literally the only power that mods that isnt just whining. and whining for years hasnt done anything. 
Jul 02 17:22:02 <EvilNight>	well what's the worst that can happen - they change the defaults to other subs
Jul 02 17:22:03 <The1RGood>	I'm focusing more on effect than motive, but yea, I know what you mean
Jul 02 17:22:06 <allthefoxes>	nothing should really get done without the community being involved, search pages, or site changes that will drastically change one of the biggest subs on the site
Jul 02 17:22:07 <EvilNight>	that would be a good thing imo
Jul 02 17:22:21 <allthefoxes>	the whole "Oh well the numbers say this" clearly isn;t working for reddit
Jul 02 17:22:24 <EvilNight>	they ban all old default mod teams - well, we take our bots and go home, the subs die
Jul 02 17:22:28 <allthefoxes>	for the community at least
Jul 02 17:22:30 <Nesquik>	Meneth, it pushed their agenda then
Jul 02 17:22:34 <redtaboo>	i think shutting down subs that aren't specifically effective will just look petty and not get the outcome people want
Jul 02 17:22:48 <redtaboo>	s/effective/effected
Jul 02 17:22:48 <gonzobot>	Correction, <redtaboo> i think shutting down subs that aren't specifically effected will just look petty and not get the outcome people want
Jul 02 17:22:49 <EvilNight>	but I worry they'll figure out a way to respond that is so spectacularly supid it actually destroys the website
Jul 02 17:22:58 <andytuba>	redtaboo: affected :p
Jul 02 17:23:03 <redtaboo>	:p
Jul 02 17:23:06 <redtaboo>	ty andytuba 
Jul 02 17:23:14 <joyouscacophony>	when in doubt, impacted is my friend :)
Jul 02 17:23:20 <Meneth>	redtaboo: All subs are affected by how terrible reddit's communication is.
Jul 02 17:23:24 <joyouscacophony>	^
Jul 02 17:23:24 <rya>	oh hi redtaboo how is ur cat
Jul 02 17:23:24 <andytuba>	works with both subreddits and teeth, joyouscacophony 
Jul 02 17:23:27 <redtaboo>	ohhh.. good ti[, joyouscacophony !
Jul 02 17:23:39 <redtaboo>	cats are great, thank rya!
Jul 02 17:23:45 <allthefoxes>	Im fine with subs going down. Idk about taking down my own, but im fine with it
Jul 02 17:23:56 <rya>	noice
Jul 02 17:23:58 <allthefoxes>	if people whining doesnt do anything, numbers will do something
Jul 02 17:24:01 <redtaboo>	Meneth they are all impacted, but every sub soing so would dilute the message, IMO
Jul 02 17:24:08 <Meneth>	All my subs are below 40k subs, and they too are affected by how shit communication is.
Jul 02 17:24:15 <rya>	redtaboo, do u rub ur cat's belly 
Jul 02 17:24:21 <Meneth>	I reported a brigade two weeks ago for example. Fuck all happened. Never got a response.
Jul 02 17:24:23 <allthefoxes>	ANYWAYS
Jul 02 17:24:25 <allthefoxes>	I need a drink
Jul 02 17:24:26 <redtaboo>	i do! I did a few minutes ago even

Jul 02 17:25:20 <redtaboo>	s/more/no
Jul 02 17:25:20 <gonzobot>	Correction, <The1RGood> I'm focusing no on effect than motive, but yea, I know what you mean

Jul 02 17:26:01 <agentlame>	It's backwards. :p
Jul 02 17:26:04 <allthefoxes>	really tho, that just seems like some hot bs to me
Jul 02 17:26:32 <allthefoxes>	Regardless of what numbers say, when people say "Hey, this critical part of the site breaks using this new thing"
Jul 02 17:26:45 <allthefoxes>	thats not even a numbers thing. Everyone will get mad at redesigns
Jul 02 17:27:03 <krispykrackers>	what are you talking about specifically?
Jul 02 17:27:16 <rya>	well this will work out i guess allthefoxes .. reddit will prob just hire someone else and bring it back to normal
Jul 02 17:27:30 <allthefoxes>	You cant moderate from the new search krispykrackers 
Jul 02 17:27:52 <krispykrackers>	ahh gotcha
Jul 02 17:27:55 <krispykrackers>	right
Jul 02 17:28:17 <agentlame>	\o/ we did it, reddit!!!!!!!!!!!! https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods/comments/3bvy6k/an_open_letter_to_the_admins_pls_sthap/csqbhdd?context=3
Jul 02 17:28:17 <gonzobot>	HOOHAH!
Jul 02 17:28:20 <allthefoxes>	thats what I meant btw
Jul 02 17:28:21 <andytuba>	thought i saw a note from tdohz that there's already a roadmap for mod tools on new search and ?feature=legacy_search int he meanwhile?
Jul 02 17:28:22 <allthefoxes>	krispykrackers, 
Jul 02 17:28:39 <allthefoxes>	I didnt mean the redesign, people get mad at a line spacing increase
Jul 02 17:28:58 <allthefoxes>	I meant the mod tools not working on search
Jul 02 17:29:18 <krispykrackers>	I hear you allthefoxes
Jul 02 17:29:29 <krispykrackers>	madlee looks like he’s going to address it
Jul 02 17:29:41 <allthefoxes>	More than a few people brought it up, and I have a sneaking feeling that it wouldnt have been "forgotten about" if everyone had that input on the UI
Jul 02 17:29:45 <allthefoxes>	rather than the UI team ;)

Jul 02 17:52:28 <coloicito>	"haha, sucks to be you"?

Jul 02 17:54:16 <kerovon>	I think what pushed science over was the nonanswers we got from admins.
Jul 02 17:54:24 <noeatnosleep>	Our tools suck. You broke our search filters. You fired the only admin who actively engaged with us.

Jul 02 17:59:13 <EvilNight>	I used to be able to scroll back 6 years on the search tabs in listentothis, now I get like a page or two of results tops... is that a RES thing or did they actually limit the results returned from search?

Jul 02 18:00:15 <ManWithoutModem>	mad at kk?
Jul 02 18:00:22 <EvilNight>	new search is officially useless *compared to old search* - be careful, we're approaching quantum-level irony here and it could destroy the earth if it gets much worse
Jul 02 18:00:26 <Meneth>	No one's mad at kk.
Jul 02 18:00:35 <Meneth>	People are mad at the admins in the abstract.

Jul 02 18:00:57 <EvilNight>	people don't even know who to be mad at, what good is rage if you canna focus it like lazers
Jul 02 18:01:00 <tizorres>	I like the new search :/
Jul 02 18:01:11 <EvilNight>	I like it's presentation... it's content is lacking
Jul 02 18:01:15 <gorillagnomes>	They limited search?

Jul 02 18:02:30 <EvilNight>	I guess I will have to craft custom google searches for the listentothis editions, perhaps that'll work better
Jul 02 18:02:45 <EvilNight>	they are already behind goo.gl links bc someone won't cough up more sidebar space... :P

Jul 02 18:10:27 <kerovon>	science recently made a bit that logs all posts and reports duplicates based on DOI, but that wouldn't work well for really any other sub.
Jul 02 18:11:00 <blueshiftlabs>	kerovon: how does the bot find the DOI from the link?
Jul 02 18:11:39 <gilgamesh>	krispykracker's how's reddit HQ at the moment?
Jul 02 18:11:40 <kerovon>	it checks both the link posted, and any links contained in it to see if there is a DOI present.
Jul 02 18:11:53 <gilgamesh>	*krispykrackers
Jul 02 18:12:12 <Coffeh>	man im getting so fat from all the redditpopcorn these days
Jul 02 18:12:17 <blueshiftlabs>	kerovon: clever trick
Jul 02 18:12:22 <kerovon>	if probably gets about 70-80% of our posts. and if they don't have a direct link to the research, then if is most likely breaking out submission rules.
Jul 02 18:12:31 <noeatnosleep>	Krispykrackers do you need me to set your username in the filter so people don't ping you incessantly?

Jul 02 18:13:51 <PM>	lol kk
Jul 02 18:14:09 <blueshiftlabs>	makes sense - least-privilege sort of thing?
Jul 02 18:14:43 <noeatnosleep>	Yeah. Why wear the badge when you don't need it? 
Jul 02 18:14:50 <tizorres>	can't you do op commands without being op? 
Jul 02 18:15:02 <blueshiftlabs>	sure, but only through
Jul 02 18:15:07 <noeatnosleep>	No without using my admin privileges. 
Jul 02 18:15:15 <noeatnosleep>	Which I don't do unless I need to. 
Jul 02 18:15:24 <tizorres>	ah
Jul 02 18:15:27 <blueshiftlabs>	Can't you do some things directly through anope?
Jul 02 18:15:34 <kwiztas>	he is ircop
Jul 02 18:15:39 <kwiztas>	he can do whatever he wants
Jul 02 18:15:44 <noeatnosleep>	Sure, but the fantasy commands are a lot easier on mobile. 
Jul 02 18:15:47 <noeatnosleep>	I'm on my phone. 
Jul 02 18:16:06 <tizorres>	cool cool
Jul 02 18:16:11 <blueshiftlabs>	ah, so *that's* what the docs meant by "fantasy commands"
Jul 02 18:16:25 <noeatnosleep>	If I use a fantasy command here without being opped it uses admin override. And there is a log of those. 
Jul 02 18:16:35 <noeatnosleep>	So I don't use them unless I'm wearing my IRCop hat.

Jul 02 18:26:24 <kwiztas>	rofl
Jul 02 18:26:30 <kwiztas>	wouldn't she be arrested?
Jul 02 18:26:33 <Tylzen>	JustPassingThrough, For me it is not if the firing was legit or not.. IT is about communication..

Jul 02 18:26:58 <Tylzen>	As I understand their mods were told by someone who had an AMA planned.
Jul 02 18:27:14 <Tylzen>	Not from Reddit, like "Hey guys, we had to let Victoria go, we will try and help you out in this transitional period"
Jul 02 18:27:27 <kwiztas>	yep
Jul 02 18:28:27 <JustPassingThrough>	hun it was a joke
Jul 02 18:28:32 <JustPassingThrough>	this is bullshit everyone knows it
Jul 02 18:28:42 <Tylzen>	The firing might be legit.. I don't know.. 
Jul 02 18:28:54 <Tylzen>	I just think how they handled, or rather didn't is what makes it embarrasing.
Jul 02 18:29:03 <gorillagnomes>	krispykrackers: that comic is great. I'm sorry about your day. :(
Jul 02 18:29:05 <JustPassingThrough>	she probably did something way less bad like multinational-scale fraud or jaywalking
Jul 02 18:29:34 <noeatnosleep>	JustPassingThrough it isn't that she was fired 
Jul 02 18:29:36 <gorillagnomes>	NENS has pooooowwwwwweeeerrrrrrssssss
Jul 02 18:29:43 <noeatnosleep>	It's that no one was hooked up to be a replacement 
Jul 02 18:29:49 <Tylzen>	Or told the IAMA crew.
Jul 02 18:29:52 <noeatnosleep>	Until after hours of screaming. 
Jul 02 18:29:54 <Tylzen>	Or the people who had AMA scheduled.
Jul 02 18:30:18 <noeatnosleep>	There should have been a successor lined up before anything happened.

Jul 02 18:32:07 <kwiztas>	PM, could be monetary not an action of hers. 
Jul 02 18:32:09 <JustPassingThrough>	it might be them
Jul 02 18:32:26 <noeatnosleep>	Tylzen: prezactly. 
Jul 02 18:32:59 <Tylzen>	And if it is a sudden firing, you still make sure the whole system doesn't collapse.
Jul 02 18:33:07 <TITRC>	they do have something set up, according to kn0thing
Jul 02 18:33:18 <Tylzen>	But having no backup plan, in case of sickness or anything for such a central person is just crazy.

Jul 02 18:33:44 <noeatnosleep>	Someone should have been tasked to do that before they axed her. 
Jul 02 18:33:57 <Tylzen>	Or just tell the IAMA people as the first thing.
Jul 02 18:34:11 <Tylzen>	Especially when they know there are daily IAMAs
Jul 02 18:34:13 <TITRC>	they'd tell her
Jul 02 18:34:46 <PM>	if a system collapses because of one employee than that is a shit system that needs to collapse. also no one other than the admins and her know whats happen. for all we know it was serious enough that they didn't have time to make proper arrangements.
Jul 02 18:35:18 <Tylzen>	You still should have a fail safe.. Like a fire plan.
Jul 02 18:35:34 <PM>	lol fire plan?
Jul 02 18:35:44 <Tylzen>	Yeah, you have evacuation plans at work places.
Jul 02 18:35:56 <Tylzen>	So if something happens suddenly, everyone knows what to do.
Jul 02 18:36:12 <PM>	yea no one does that
Jul 02 18:36:30 <Tylzen>	Same with organisations and companies, if an important employee is unable to do their job, someone else can fill in temporarily, or the area can be "closed until fixed"
Jul 02 18:36:42 <Tylzen>	Well the organisation I am on the board of does.
Jul 02 18:36:43 <PM>	they do 
Jul 02 18:36:50 <TITRC>	emails to ama@reddit.com are going to be responded to
Jul 02 18:37:01 <PM>	look at knothing comments.
Jul 02 18:37:17 <Tylzen>	Yes, but it is about how they handled the situation.
Jul 02 18:37:20 <Tylzen>	It was amateurish.
Jul 02 18:37:43 <Tylzen>	Even if it is sudden, they had no plan on how to handle AMA
Jul 02 18:38:30 ---	ButtServ gives channel operator status to MillenniumFalc0n
Jul 02 18:38:40 ---	MillenniumFalc0n sets invite on R:Makiavelzx
Jul 02 18:38:42 ---	MillenniumFalc0n removes channel operator status from MillenniumFalc0n
Jul 02 18:39:16 <TITRC>	look, you can't tell the IAmA mods about this without one of them leaking to chooter
Jul 02 18:39:34 <TITRC>	as it was, within 45 minutes, kn0thing was in /r/iamamods telling them what's up
Jul 02 18:39:38 <TITRC>	that's the chair of the company
Jul 02 18:39:51 <TITRC>	you can't exactly recruit for her position while she's still IN IT
Jul 02 18:40:01 <TITRC>	they were between a rock and a hard place here
Jul 02 18:40:12 <supergauntlet>	https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/
Jul 02 18:40:13 <supergauntlet>	hohoho
Jul 02 18:40:25 <supergauntlet>	GodOfAtheism: : ^ )
Jul 02 18:40:28 <MillenniumFalc0n>	wonder what happened that they felt the need to fire her without any notice
Jul 02 18:41:09 <Tylzen>	TITRC, You don't have to tell the mods the reason, just that she had been let go.. And it wasn't the admins who told the mods.
Jul 02 18:41:14 <elfa82>	MillenniumFalc0n, SRD should go private in solidarity!
Jul 02 18:41:32 <CosmicKeys>	I'll take you private
Jul 02 18:41:44 <MillenniumFalc0n>	then we could all move to subredditdramadrama!
Jul 02 18:41:53 <TITRC>	yes, they did that within an hour of letting her go, Tylzen
Jul 02 18:41:56 <elfa82>	Yes please at CK and you
Jul 02 18:42:03 <TITRC>	kn0thing went to their sub and told them
Jul 02 18:42:11 <MillenniumFalc0n>	well they did that after karmanaut shut down the sub
Jul 02 18:42:16 <supergauntlet>	https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3bwwb6/reddit_abruptly_fires_ama_liason_victoria_in_the/csqcnus?context=1
Jul 02 18:42:18 <supergauntlet>	for what purpose 
Jul 02 18:42:20 <MillenniumFalc0n>	so who knows if he was going to do that if that hadn't happened
Jul 02 18:42:24 <supergauntlet>	would you comment in CB as an admin
Jul 02 18:42:25 <supergauntlet>	:^(
Jul 02 18:43:08 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Still too late, they should had been there before some random agent.
Jul 02 18:44:16 <TITRC>	so you're upset that 45 minutes passed between the firing and the chairman of the company personally informing them of the decision?
Jul 02 18:44:18 <TITRC>	that seems unreasonable
Jul 02 18:44:35 <krispykrackers>	movies is private
Jul 02 18:44:36 <krispykrackers>	wonderful
Jul 02 18:44:55 <supergauntlet>	yknow
Jul 02 18:45:05 <MillenniumFalc0n>	krispykrackers: you had to see that coming with kleinbl00 near the top 
Jul 02 18:45:09 <supergauntlet>	i know going private is a thing to try and get the admins to respond
Jul 02 18:45:10 <supergauntlet>	but
Jul 02 18:45:14 <MillenniumFalc0n>	and girafa's post in modtalk
Jul 02 18:45:21 <supergauntlet>	the only people this annoys or bothers is the community management team
Jul 02 18:45:28 <supergauntlet>	...who have nothing to do with Victoria's firing
Jul 02 18:45:35 <CosmicKeys>	Seems like a lot of protest for a situation nobody seems to know much about
Jul 02 18:45:36 <TITRC>	yeah I don't know the point they're trying to make here
Jul 02 18:45:38 <Tylzen>	TITRC, I am not upset, I am just surprised that they were slower than some random agent, trying to know what happened to his clients scheduled AMA
Jul 02 18:45:43 <supergauntlet>	like kn0thing literally does not give a shit about this
Jul 02 18:45:45 <supergauntlet>	its reddit
Jul 02 18:45:49 <supergauntlet>	it'll blow over in a week 
Jul 02 18:45:53 <Nesquik>	whats the list on defaults gone private now?
Jul 02 18:45:55 <CosmicKeys>	What if she was upvoting herself in /r/circlejerk on multiple accounts, egregious
Jul 02 18:46:00 <supergauntlet>	CosmicKeys: banned
Jul 02 18:46:02 <multi-mod>	It's a jolly good day for a bit of a ruckus
Jul 02 18:46:16 <PM>	lol movies..... I will seriously demod myself of any sub I mod that does that. 
Jul 02 18:46:28 <x_minus_one>	bye felicia
Jul 02 18:46:29 <joyouscacophony>	Why?
Jul 02 18:46:54 <werner__herzog>	"Three defaults go private after Admin gets fired for planing and executing a big heist."
Jul 02 18:47:05 <supergauntlet>	werner__herzog: wat
Jul 02 18:47:05 <TITRC>	I find all this completely silly. 45 minutes passed in a tiny bit of confusion, and this is the fallout.
Jul 02 18:47:08 <TITRC>	ridiculous
Jul 02 18:47:12 <multi-mod>	That would be awesome if true werner
Jul 02 18:47:19 <gorillagnomes>	It's not just about Victoria. It's about search, it's about mod tools, it's about admin support with doxxing, ban evasion, etc...
Jul 02 18:47:38 <TITRC>	then let's be grownups about it.
Jul 02 18:47:44 <x_minus_one>	The firing that broke the unpaid volunteer's back, if you will.
Jul 02 18:48:00 <werner__herzog>	"The heist ended in her jumping from one skyscraper to the next in one of the most expensive cars in the world."
Jul 02 18:48:01 <MillenniumFalc0n>	so just continue to complain in announcement/changelog/beta threads and be completely ignored?
Jul 02 18:48:12 <MillenniumFalc0n>	TITRC: I'm not saying this is the right way to go about things, but I"m certainly sympathetic
Jul 02 18:48:15 <CosmicKeys>	Lol werner__herzog 
Jul 02 18:48:28 <TITRC>	no one is being ignored here
Jul 02 18:48:34 <MillenniumFalc0n>	wat
Jul 02 18:48:34 <multi-mod>	I can't even check if a user is submitting the same youtube channel through search any more
Jul 02 18:48:37 <Tylzen>	TITRC, At least he admits that he did it too slowly https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqe9a6?context=3
Jul 02 18:48:53 <TITRC>	and considering this the straw that broke the redditor's back? like, c'mon. 
Jul 02 18:49:00 <werner__herzog>	guys, I don't wanna go to sleep, but I have to
Jul 02 18:49:09 <werner__herzog>	have fun you crazy Americans
Jul 02 18:49:17 <werner__herzog>	with your firings and your secrets

Jul 02 18:50:10 <supergauntlet>	what i'm really curious about is that this seemed to be a planned move? if they have a team ready and are planning something in the future for AMAs
Jul 02 18:50:18 <supergauntlet>	why remove victoria so suddenly and not let anyone know
Jul 02 18:50:24 <multi-mod>	"team"
Jul 02 18:50:29 <supergauntlet>	ah right
Jul 02 18:50:35 <CosmicKeys>	Was she "fired"?
Jul 02 18:50:36 <supergauntlet>	aka
Jul 02 18:50:57 <PM>	the search is horrible, and I would agree to a protest about that but the ama admin being fired? nah I worked in too many places, seem to many "good workers" fired to get behind that.
Jul 02 18:51:13 <CosmicKeys>	Letting someone go is a touchy move for any company, I can see that they'd be focused on that side of it and not keeping IAMA running

Jul 02 18:51:20 <gonzobot>	(Tylzen) @edfrenkel (Edward Frenkel): Details on the shutting down of @reddit_AMA in the middle of my AMA: https://t.co/bO3os0ZFmp All this sounds really bad and unprofessional. (5 hours and 12 minutes ago)
Jul 02 18:51:50 <TITRC>	supergauntlet: this was not sudden
Jul 02 18:51:56 <TITRC>	this shit doesn't just pop up
Jul 02 18:52:03 <TITRC>	they just couldn't tell us, for obvious reasons
Jul 02 18:52:10 <supergauntlet>	i mean if it wasn't do you think she got a 2 weeks notice
Jul 02 18:52:21 <multi-mod>	with all these subs going private it's just going to be pics, funny, and aww on my front page
Jul 02 18:52:23 <supergauntlet>	i dont quite get why they didn't tell anyone
Jul 02 18:52:31 <Tylzen>	I would call it sudden, when AMAs are shut down midsentence.
Jul 02 18:52:34 <joyouscacophony>	It was a bullshit move by management TITRC
Jul 02 18:52:34 <blueshiftlabs>	TITRC: consider that, even if this was sudden, they may have had a bockup plan in place
Jul 02 18:52:54 <multi-mod>	was their backup plan to have no backup plan?
Jul 02 18:52:56 <krispykrackers>	it’s interesting that you use the word “remove”. is this being seen as a super-helpful-power-mod being removed from a subreddit rather than a reddit employee bein glet go?
Jul 02 18:52:58 <TITRC>	supergauntlet: because you don't announce upcoming firings to a giant website?
Jul 02 18:52:59 <Tylzen>	multi-mod, They are going to bring back adviceanimsl, to fill in for AMA :P
Jul 02 18:53:01 <blueshiftlabs>	for if Victoria got sick, or hit by a bus, or something like that
Jul 02 18:53:10 <supergauntlet>	TITRC: they didn't have to? 
Jul 02 18:53:27 <supergauntlet>	they could have just told the mods 'hey theres some stuff going on with reddit-handled AMAs, just fyi'
Jul 02 18:53:30 <multi-mod>	yishan explained why they fired that one guy
Jul 02 18:53:40 <supergauntlet>	multi-mod: which was a hilariously bad idea btw
Jul 02 18:53:42 <x_minus_one>	and that worked out well
Jul 02 18:53:46 <PM>	KK I would say people are thinking the former.
Jul 02 18:53:47 <TITRC>	multi-mod: yeah that was kind of a special case, and not a good idea
Jul 02 18:53:53 <TITRC>	supergauntlet: when?
Jul 02 18:54:04 <TITRC>	before? how would that help?
Jul 02 18:54:08 <multi-mod>	just yishan being yishan
Jul 02 18:54:08 <TITRC>	after? they did that, within an hour
Jul 02 18:54:21 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Kn0ting even admits he did it too slowly.
Jul 02 18:54:24 <supergauntlet>	even a few hours notice would have probably avoided this 
Jul 02 18:54:37 <Tylzen>	They had no backup in such a case, they had AMAs planned.
Jul 02 18:54:47 <TITRC>	sure, maybe the first thing he does is go straight to the computer and notify /r/iamamods
Jul 02 18:54:51 <Tylzen>	As blueshiftlabs also points out, what if Victoria had been sick or in an accident.
Jul 02 18:55:07 <Tylzen>	Yes.
Jul 02 18:55:15 <Tylzen>	Considering how big IAMA is for the site.
Jul 02 18:55:23 <TITRC>	and "a few hours notice"? how classless would it be to tell the mods before they told her? and how do you keep them from leaking it to her?
Jul 02 18:55:28 <CosmicKeys>	"Petition to call this drama "victoria's secret"" - lol
Jul 02 18:55:28 <TITRC>	leaking it to her would've been the worst thing
Jul 02 18:55:33 <multi-mod>	it completely knocks out one of their main mobile apps
Jul 02 18:55:35 <Tylzen>	TITRC, You can do both.
Jul 02 18:55:41 <kwiztas>	already is CosmicKeys 
Jul 02 18:55:52 <Tylzen>	I am pretty sure they had a PC or smartphone within reach, when they let Victoria go.
Jul 02 18:55:58 <CosmicKeys>	Neato (    ͡° ͜  ͡°    )
Jul 02 18:56:03 <multi-mod>	they did it by carrier pigeon
Jul 02 18:56:06 <TITRC>	yes, it took 45 minutes. I'm sure Alexis is sorry.
Jul 02 18:56:09 <Tylzen>	Oh yeah, their IAMA app
Jul 02 18:56:09 <supergauntlet>	i dunno what's done is done, I just don't get why the hell iama is private still
Jul 02 18:56:17 <TITRC>	that the iama mods had to wait 45 minutes
Jul 02 18:56:25 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Yes, he admits he was too slow.
Jul 02 18:56:35 <TITRC>	OK, so all this over 45 minutes of radio silence
Jul 02 18:56:38 <TITRC>	silly
Jul 02 18:56:40 <Tylzen>	supergauntlet, Because they have none to handle the IAMAs.
Jul 02 18:56:51 <supergauntlet>	didn't kn0thing say somewhere that they do now
Jul 02 18:56:54 <kwiztas>	they found out thru a modmail from a scheduled iama not admins. 
Jul 02 18:56:59 <Tylzen>	supergauntlet, To handle the emails.
Jul 02 18:57:05 <Tylzen>	supergauntlet, But none to fill in for Victoria.
Jul 02 18:57:11 <supergauntlet>	welp
Jul 02 18:57:19 <CosmicKeys>	supergauntlet: As a moderator I reserve the absolute authority to hold my subscribers content hostage at any time, for any whim, as a god under only god 
Jul 02 18:57:24 <supergauntlet>	xd
Jul 02 18:57:25 <TITRC>	how exactly would you pull that off? be recuiting FOR her job WHILE she's in it, Tylzen?
Jul 02 18:57:37 <Tylzen>	TITRC, HAVE SOMEONE ELSE FILL IN.
Jul 02 18:57:39 <Tylzen>	:)
Jul 02 18:57:55 <Tylzen>	It might not be as good, but it is better than none.
Jul 02 18:58:09 <TITRC>	ummm… who? just pull another reddit employee off their normal job? and say "your job is now to deal with the AMA mods"?
Jul 02 18:58:16 <Tylzen>	Yeah
Jul 02 18:58:23 <blueshiftlabs>	TITRC: it's called having a substitute
Jul 02 18:58:29 <Tylzen>	I presume many of them are project orientated.
Jul 02 18:58:46 <Tylzen>	Just like if someone are in an accident or become suddenly ill
Jul 02 18:58:51 <kerovon>	In /r/science, it was because even after the firing, we were not getting any response with substance after several hours of trying to get them.  We are currently scrambling to rescue a massive AMA we were planning.
Jul 02 18:58:53 <blueshiftlabs>	anything mission-critical like this
Jul 02 18:59:01 <blueshiftlabs>	you *always* have at least two people on it
Jul 02 18:59:07 <coloicito>	What was /r/music's reasoning?
Jul 02 18:59:17 <blueshiftlabs>	it's called "bus factor"
Jul 02 18:59:29 <Nesquik>	/r/music is private too?
Jul 02 18:59:36 <coloicito>	yesp
Jul 02 18:59:37 <Tylzen>	r/movies too last I checked.
Jul 02 18:59:49 <blueshiftlabs>	not for me
Jul 02 18:59:52 <TITRC>	yeah, I'm sorry, I think this is still wildly overblown. as it is, you are still going to get your emails to ama@ answered. that you won't have someone to answer text messages is something that's livable until they find a replacement.
Jul 02 18:59:56 <Nesquik>	music seems up still
Jul 02 19:00:11 <XenoBen>	maybe victoria will go to voat /s
Jul 02 19:00:12 <coloicito>	wops, sorry
Jul 02 19:00:17 <coloicito>	I meant /r/movies, my bad
Jul 02 19:00:27 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Yes, but not the IAMAS handled.. 
Jul 02 19:00:30 <blueshiftlabs>	that brings it up to, what, 3 defaults total?
Jul 02 19:00:38 <greenduch>	4 ?
Jul 02 19:00:46 <coloicito>	3 defaults + circlejerk
Jul 02 19:01:21 <Tylzen>	TITRC, The IAMA mods have already made it clear they need a person like Victoria to fill that role.
Jul 02 19:01:23 <kwiztas>	if we get lol in on this we win
Jul 02 19:01:24 <gorillagnomes>	xenoben lol
Jul 02 19:01:24 <x_minus_one>	You mean circlejerk isn't a default???
Jul 02 19:01:33 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Answering emails is not that.
Jul 02 19:01:47 <TITRC>	gosh, "need". see, that's the frustrating part. 
Jul 02 19:01:53 <Nesquik>	cj becoming a default would be ironic
Jul 02 19:01:58 <kwiztas>	XenoBen, predict the outcome of this please
Jul 02 19:01:59 <multi-mod>	Are the emails to AMA going to actually be answered?
Jul 02 19:02:02 <kwiztas>	he is really on point
Jul 02 19:02:38 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Why is that frustrating? Before her, the AMA quality was horrible, and not consisent.
Jul 02 19:02:43 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Or would you rather discuss Rampant?
Jul 02 19:03:00 <Tylzen>	Has anyone actually watched that movie?
Jul 02 19:03:09 <TITRC>	I'm not saying that she didn't do great work, I'm not saying that it was better before her, none of this
Jul 02 19:03:31 <TITRC>	but all this freakout over not being informed about this, and having to work around it for a few weeks?
Jul 02 19:03:32 <Tylzen>	TITRC, But you don't think it was a critical position, considering the role of IAMA on Reddit.
Jul 02 19:04:06 <multi-mod>	Deimorz, KK, and chooter were essentially the front facing reddit employees
Jul 02 19:04:08 <Tylzen>	TITRC, The "freakout" for me, is that it showed that Reddit had no backup plan, or can handle a sudden firing of an employee
Jul 02 19:04:28 <TITRC>	here is the backup plan: email ama@reddit.com until they find a replacement.
Jul 02 19:04:34 <TITRC>	that has been made clear
Jul 02 19:04:44 <Tylzen>	TITRC, That is not a backup plan, that is panic.
Jul 02 19:04:50 <TITRC>	no, it's not
Jul 02 19:04:52 <TITRC>	what?
Jul 02 19:05:25 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Backup plan is having someone that can fill in, so the daily amas are not interrupted (someone who was a dedicated backup in case something happened)
Jul 02 19:05:45 <XenoBen>	kwiztas: some story from admins that probably never happened
Jul 02 19:05:50 <multi-mod>	they could have even redirected KK to do it
Jul 02 19:05:50 <XenoBen>	and promises to move ob
Jul 02 19:05:52 <kerovon>	If ama@reddit.com was responsive, maybe.  If they don't respond for over 3 hours to specific questions about the final stages of finalizing a major ama that we were trying to get locked in today, that is a problem. Going private got /r/science to start getting mroe responses.
Jul 02 19:05:55 <Tylzen>	TITRC, A backup plan is something you have ready to deploy within minutes, not hours.
Jul 02 19:06:01 <krispykrackers>	3 hours isn’t very long
Jul 02 19:06:11 <multi-mod>	3 hours is the life of an AMA
Jul 02 19:06:20 <TITRC>	you expect someone else on the (very small) reddit team to abandon their daily job role and concentrate solely on AMAs for an indeterminate amount of time?
Jul 02 19:06:22 <Tylzen>	3 hours is long when the person is tweeting aobut it :D
Jul 02 19:06:26 <TITRC>	that is not reasonable

Jul 02 19:06:37 <JustPassingThrough>	F
Jul 02 19:06:57 <Tylzen>	TITRC, Yes, for a day or two, since IAMAS is a massive part of the publicity of Reddit.
Jul 02 19:07:09 <multi-mod>	KK, I can tell you are sad from all the talking you are doing :(
Jul 02 19:07:11 <Tylzen>	TITRC, That is how most organisations and companies work.
Jul 02 19:07:18 <Tylzen>	They don't just let a whole section fall.
Jul 02 19:07:19 <kerovon>	That is on top of the time when we weren't getting any responses despite modmailing reddit.com, emailing reddit, asking Pao, asking kn0thing
Jul 02 19:07:24 <Tylzen>	And tell people to email them.
Jul 02 19:07:31 <kerovon>	Then emailing the email address and getting no response
Jul 02 19:07:33 <TITRC>	you're really assigning a LOT of importance to this that I think is unwarranted
Jul 02 19:07:36 <allthefoxes>	TITRC, well, there was someone who was doing that, but they got fired
Jul 02 19:07:38 <TITRC>	as it is, it's going to be more than two days
Jul 02 19:07:39 <XenoBen>	has victoria posted at all?
Jul 02 19:07:41 <allthefoxes>	is the point
Jul 02 19:07:44 <allthefoxes>	XenoBen, yeah in /r/pics
Jul 02 19:07:51 <XenoBen>	what she say?
Jul 02 19:07:51 <kerovon>	the only response we got was"email us", until we shut down.
Jul 02 19:07:54 <allthefoxes>	Just stuff
Jul 02 19:07:55 <Tylzen>	TITRC, It is important enough to have the president of the USA being on there.
Jul 02 19:07:55 <multi-mod>	victoria has been chatting, seems fine with the whole thing
Jul 02 19:08:04 <Tylzen>	IAMA is a big part of reddit, and most know about it.
Jul 02 19:08:04 <TITRC>	yeah, the president was also on marc maron last week
Jul 02 19:08:11 <XenoBen>	I feel we are missing a big part of the story
Jul 02 19:08:19 <TITRC>	you're right XenoBen
Jul 02 19:08:23 <TITRC>	which is why I find this all silly
Jul 02 19:08:23 <coloicito>	Yes, the reasons behind this
Jul 02 19:08:37 <Tylzen>	The reason behind it is not what I care about..
Jul 02 19:08:41 <Tylzen>	I care about how they handled it.
Jul 02 19:08:50 <MillenniumFalc0n>	allthefoxes: come on man, you can do *so* much better than Jack at that price point
Jul 02 19:08:52 <XenoBen>	It all seems very sudden. Like spare of the moment.
Jul 02 19:08:54 <Tylzen>	But TITRC doesn't consider IAMA one of the biggest parts of Reddit.
Jul 02 19:09:02 <TITRC>	of course that's exactly waht I said
Jul 02 19:09:03 <MillenniumFalc0n>	and if you're broke you can do fine for cheaper
Jul 02 19:09:04 <TITRC>	oh wait
Jul 02 19:09:06 <TITRC>	it's totally not
Jul 02 19:09:07 <Tylzen>	XenoBen, Still you would have a "bus-factor" plan.
Jul 02 19:09:10 <allthefoxes>	TITRC, Victoria is gone, and people will have to deal with it its the lack of caring and communication that the staff have for us
Jul 02 19:09:11 <MillenniumFalc0n>	for instance, I'm drinking a $28 dollar handle of four roses yellow label
Jul 02 19:09:30 <krispykrackers>	that’s so unfair allthefoxes
Jul 02 19:09:58 <allthefoxes>	I'm sorry. but this is not the first terrible mess reddit has left.
Jul 02 19:09:58 <XenoBen>	Tylzen: Doesnt look that good atm.
Jul 02 19:09:59 <joyouscacophony>	allthefoxes - this isn't staff.  This is management
Jul 02 19:10:07 <allthefoxes>	Yes, you are right joyouscacophony 
Jul 02 19:10:08 <allthefoxes>	sorry
Jul 02 19:10:13 <krispykrackers>	“reddit” and “the admins” aren’t one entity
Jul 02 19:10:17 <krispykrackers>	just like “redditors” aren’t one person
Jul 02 19:10:19 <Wodashit>	This is one of the greatest time for popcorn
Jul 02 19:10:22 <Tylzen>	The admins doesn't hire and fire people.
Jul 02 19:10:25 <joyouscacophony>	Lies krispykrackers
Jul 02 19:10:31 <allthefoxes>	We all know you are the borg
Jul 02 19:10:32 <allthefoxes>	dont lie
Jul 02 19:10:33 <joyouscacophony>	There's only karmanaut
Jul 02 19:10:33 <Tylzen>	But they didn't inform IAMA either.
Jul 02 19:10:34 <Tylzen>	In time.
Jul 02 19:11:11 <krispykrackers>	how unprofessional would it be to tell a mod team that an employee was being let go, before letting that employee know? I don’t understand why anyone thinks that’s something we should have actually done?
Jul 02 19:11:11 <Wodashit>	Do we know the reasons why btw?
Jul 02 19:11:25 <allthefoxes>	How about actually having a plan then
Jul 02 19:11:28 <allthefoxes>	when they do go
Jul 02 19:11:46 <Wodashit>	krispykrackers: I guess it's letting everyone know before hand.
Jul 02 19:11:46 <allthefoxes>	rather than the iama mods having some random person tell them "Hey thyre gone" and let them figure it out for a few hours
Jul 02 19:11:50 ---	ButtServ gives channel operator status to MillenniumFalc0n
Jul 02 19:12:01 ---	MillenniumFalc0n sets invite on R:ivashkin
Jul 02 19:12:07 <multi-mod>	does going private automatically disable your default status once you make it public again?
Jul 02 19:12:10 <krispykrackers>	tell… everyone before… tellign the person? I don’t understand?
Jul 02 19:12:11 <allthefoxes>	No
Jul 02 19:12:14 ---	MillenniumFalc0n removes channel operator status from MillenniumFalc0n
Jul 02 19:12:23 <rya|AwayFightingMummies>	only for iama team krispykrackers 
Jul 02 19:12:23 <x_minus_one>	so many new people today
Jul 02 19:12:28 <Tylzen>	krispykrackers, I cannot see how they couldn't have told them right after the point.
Jul 02 19:12:39 <Tylzen>	As if Reddit doesn't have access to phones or PCs 
Jul 02 19:12:42 <Ivashkin>	hello /r/europe mod here
Jul 02 19:12:46 <allthefoxes>	Hi Ivashkin 
Jul 02 19:12:48 <Makiavelzx>	krispykrackers : By that point, Victoria had to know didn't she? Otherwise how would that AMA participant have known about it?
Jul 02 19:12:52 <Tylzen>	IAMA mods were told about it via some random agent in modmail.
Jul 02 19:12:52 <greenduch>	or tried to have *something* in place that wasnt just hashtag yolo
Jul 02 19:12:52 <allthefoxes>	Complemntary popcorn to the right
Jul 02 19:12:56 <Wodashit>	krispykrackers: tell everyone including the person and handling that well especially if it's for public relations

Jul 02 19:13:08 <greenduch>	welcome, Ivashkin 
Jul 02 19:13:11 <TehAlpacalypse>	I just found out not 20 minutes ago, but I think this was really rushed and really fucked Iama
Jul 02 19:13:15 <TehAlpacalypse>	I've gotta go
Jul 02 19:13:15 <x_minus_one>	Like I'm actually making popcorn tho
Jul 02 19:13:18 <rya|AwayFightingMummies>	like dey shud have atleast told about using ama@reddit.com atleast krispykrackers.. than just jumping it on them
Jul 02 19:13:25 *	Ivashkin quietly takes a seat in the corner 
Jul 02 19:13:39 <Tylzen>	Ivashkin, Hi.
Jul 02 19:13:41 <joyouscacophony>	hey Ivashkin
Jul 02 19:13:45 <Wodashit>	x_minus_one: well, salt or sugar?
Jul 02 19:13:48 <allthefoxes>	In general, I'm more salty about the general tone of reddit lately anyways, this is just another thing to put in the books.
Jul 02 19:13:51 <Tylzen>	Ivashkin, I never been to Europe.. I heard it is a scary place.
Jul 02 19:13:53 <CosmicKeys>	krispy is right, there's no way you would tell anyone below an employee's level being let go before they do
Jul 02 19:14:01 <allthefoxes>	CosmicKeys, no one needed to know before
Jul 02 19:14:08 <allthefoxes>	they should have had a plan though when it did happen
Jul 02 19:14:09 <Wodashit>	Tylzen: come on...
Jul 02 19:14:12 <Tylzen>	You don't have to tell them she is being fired..
Jul 02 19:14:14 <coloicito>	I'm out of touch with US's laws. Can an employer simply tell someone "you're fired" and have him/her leave on the spot, without giving them a time notice or something?
Jul 02 19:14:21 <multi-mod>	I wonder what she did that was so bad she didn't get notice
Jul 02 19:14:21 <allthefoxes>	coloicito, yes
Jul 02 19:14:22 <x_minus_one>	yes
Jul 02 19:14:25 <Tylzen>	They could have been told "Hey something is up, we need to put IAMAS on hold"
Jul 02 19:14:25 <PM>	krispykrackers, reddit is full users young enough not have have work at a company. only reason I can see for people saying they should have known as soon as the employee.
Jul 02 19:14:26 <x_minus_one>	'murica sucks
Jul 02 19:14:30 <rya|AwayFightingMummies>	no one was asking reddit to do an announcement kk..
Jul 02 19:14:30 <allthefoxes>	At-will I think
Jul 02 19:14:37 <coloicito>	hm
Jul 02 19:14:38 <CosmicKeys>	There's just a ton of assumptions I suppose, nobody even knows why she was let go so maybe it was an emergency
Jul 02 19:14:41 <rya|AwayFightingMummies>	just a heads up to iama team
Jul 02 19:14:46 <Flashynuff>	hey krispykrackers, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that you're taking the time to talk to us here. I think the biggest problem a lot of people have is a lack of mod-admin communication, and you being here makes things considerably better. So thank you!
Jul 02 19:14:48 <CosmicKeys>	Or, at least that's one radical example
Jul 02 19:14:50 <snarkypants>	im here for the iama gossip
Jul 02 19:14:52 <coloicito>	Wait, in this case which laws would apply? California's or New York's?
Jul 02 19:14:55 <allthefoxes>	I do too, I love you kk <3
Jul 02 19:15:04 <Tylzen>	How could a random agent tell the mods before the admins.
Jul 02 19:15:06 <multi-mod>	KK you tha woman
Jul 02 19:15:08 <XenoBen>	most of us are snarkypants 
Jul 02 19:15:15 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, <3
Jul 02 19:15:17 <snarkypants>	fill me in
Jul 02 19:15:29 <snarkypants>	i just read the title and am too lazy to click further
Jul 02 19:15:31 <Wodashit>	PM: The reason is, this is hurting your image more than anything, especially on a community driven website
Jul 02 19:15:37 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Random agent mailed the mods of IAMA about what was up, they find out that Victoria has been fired.
Jul 02 19:15:41 <multi-mod>	snarkypants, shit went down, there was a trident, and now there is a war between man and machine
Jul 02 19:15:47 <allthefoxes>	People keep saying its about them knowing before victoria but thats not really whats up (its about ethics in game journalism), but having a plan for when Victoria is gone.
Jul 02 19:15:49 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, IAMA goes private, Kn0t comes in and orientates.
Jul 02 19:15:51 <EvilNight>	fuck me now /r/movies too
Jul 02 19:15:52 <snarkypants>	fired? or just no longer working for the company
Jul 02 19:15:52 <CosmicKeys>	All this IAMA drama is actually getting in the way of my normal irc shitposting, thank you very much
Jul 02 19:15:54 *	MillenniumFalc0n waves at snarkypants 
Jul 02 19:15:57 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Movies, and Science are down too
Jul 02 19:16:01 <allthefoxes>	snarkypants, "laid off"
Jul 02 19:16:02 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Yup.
Jul 02 19:16:02 <EvilNight>	this is starting to snowball people - are you sure you want to go this way
Jul 02 19:16:13 <snarkypants>	"terminated" or "laid off"
Jul 02 19:16:13 <EvilNight>	point of no return, this is it
Jul 02 19:16:14 <Wodashit>	CosmicKeys: You are welcome =)
Jul 02 19:16:18 <allthefoxes>	fine
Jul 02 19:16:22 <allthefoxes>	let me shitpost something
Jul 02 19:16:23 <allthefoxes>	hmm
Jul 02 19:16:26 <kerovon>	I don't mind that they didn't warn us first honestly. I mind that they didn't appear to have any of their upper people ready to handle the issues until it blew up.  /r/science is still waiting on getting answers to the questions we asked.
Jul 02 19:16:28 <snarkypants>	because employment termination does not mean fired
Jul 02 19:16:29 <allthefoxes>	Oh, I know
Jul 02 19:16:32 <allthefoxes>	kebab++
Jul 02 19:16:35 <XenoBen>	snarkypants:  unexpectedly let go
Jul 02 19:16:35 <snarkypants>	it just means the person is no longer working there
Jul 02 19:16:46 <snarkypants>	what if she got an awesome job somewhere
Jul 02 19:16:52 <snarkypants>	maybe its a promotion
Jul 02 19:16:58 <allthefoxes>	snarkypants, nope, shes gone
Jul 02 19:17:01 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Reddit still had no backup.
Jul 02 19:17:01 <allthefoxes>	not working for reddit
Jul 02 19:17:15 <werner__herzog>	chooter for new ceo confirmed
Jul 02 19:17:15 <Wodashit>	allthefoxes: K++15?
Jul 02 19:17:16 <snarkypants>	well right, maybe she got a job managing social media for somebody else
Jul 02 19:17:22 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Like IAMA shut down, and the admins are like just mail ama@reddit.com
Jul 02 19:17:29 <snarkypants>	like a presidential candidate or something
Jul 02 19:17:29 <Makiavelzx>	seeing how she appears to be going to visit her husband's family, I doubt it
Jul 02 19:17:32 <allthefoxes>	3 hours after the fact Tylzen 
Jul 02 19:17:36 <allthefoxes>	not right when it happened
Jul 02 19:17:42 <Tylzen>	allthefoxes, That is fast enough for TITRC  :P
Jul 02 19:17:44 <allthefoxes>	once it became a shit storm though, they started to do something
Jul 02 19:17:52 <x_minus_one>	considering that she's been posting, though, you'd think she'd at least be like "yo, it's cool, y'all"
Jul 02 19:17:59 <snarkypants>	or... depop
Jul 02 19:17:59 <TITRC>	45 minutes. it took 45 minutes.
Jul 02 19:17:59 <PM>	she is fired. people are only let go this way for "a reason". what that reason is, fuck if I know.
Jul 02 19:18:00 <Tylzen>	Because allthefoxes you cannot have people who do their daily job, do ANYTHING else :D
Jul 02 19:18:02 <allthefoxes>	as is usual for reddit : ^ ) Only ackowldge it when its blown up
Jul 02 19:18:05 <snarkypants>	isn't depop hiring right now?/
Jul 02 19:18:05 <XenoBen>	guys i think we are missing someone. WHAT ABOUT THE BERNIE SANDERS AMAS??!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?
Jul 02 19:18:20 <Tylzen>	XenoBen, He can do it in Casualiama.
Jul 02 19:18:22 <Tylzen>	:D
Jul 02 19:18:30 <Tylzen>	Together with the 10 other Bernie Sanders.
Jul 02 19:18:50 <x_minus_one>	lol
Jul 02 19:19:19 <Wodashit>	Tylzen: well the wife would be happy then
Jul 02 19:19:30 <multi-mod>	was there really a bernie AMA scheduled?
Jul 02 19:19:31 <Tylzen>	Wodashit, Which one of them? There are 11 of them
Jul 02 19:19:40 <Tylzen>	multi-mod, Who knows.. 
Jul 02 19:19:44 <XenoBen>	see, if bernie was president this never would have happened
Jul 02 19:19:45 <Tylzen>	Any IAMA mods on here?

Jul 02 19:20:17 <Wodashit>	Tylzen: The latest one probably, admitting that's not at the same time
Jul 02 19:20:19 <allthefoxes>	First a podcast, now a different thing?
Jul 02 19:20:33 <Tylzen>	I wonder what the fuck they will do with their IAMA app :D
Jul 02 19:20:41 <snarkypants>	probably hire somebody else
Jul 02 19:20:46 <Tylzen>	A new update - Open the app "Please email us at ama@reddit.com"
Jul 02 19:20:55 <Wodashit>	Tylzen: Shove it
Jul 02 19:21:08 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, It is just hillariously sad they didn't have some kind of substitute ready for emergencies.
Jul 02 19:21:17 <Tylzen>	Wodashit, I don't have a shovel :(
Jul 02 19:21:29 <teaearlgraycold>	Do y'all think we'll ever get an explanation as to why Victoria left reddit/was kicked out of reddit?
Jul 02 19:21:36 <allthefoxes>	Actually it wasnt 45 minutes, it was around 2 hours
Jul 02 19:21:36 <elfa82>	no
Jul 02 19:21:37 <x_minus_one>	only if yishan comes back
Jul 02 19:21:37 <Wodashit>	Tylzen: I meant their apps, wasn't fast enough, sry
Jul 02 19:21:43 <werner__herzog>	no and that's probably a good thing
Jul 02 19:21:51 <teaearlgraycold>	Tylzen, kn0thing is their backup
Jul 02 19:21:57 <teaearlgraycold>	He says he's covering in the mean time
Jul 02 19:22:10 <allthefoxes>	IAMA went private at 13:00 - ama@reddit.com was up at 15:15
Jul 02 19:22:13 <Tylzen>	teaearlgraycold, He did? All I have read from him is email ama@reddit.com
Jul 02 19:22:16 <allthefoxes>	so, 2 hours
Jul 02 19:22:20 <Wodashit>	teaearlgraycold: Was not really effective
Jul 02 19:22:33 <teaearlgraycold>	Tylzen, that's what he said in a comment
Jul 02 19:22:33 <Tylzen>	Wait they didn't have ama@reddit.com all the time?
Jul 02 19:22:36 <Tylzen>	They just made it right now?
Jul 02 19:22:37 <creesch>	r/history just went private
Jul 02 19:22:44 <teaearlgraycold>	I thought ama@reddit wasn't new
Jul 02 19:22:50 <teaearlgraycold>	Shit
Jul 02 19:22:53 <Tylzen>	God that makes it even more hillarious
Jul 02 19:22:54 <teaearlgraycold>	creesch, like JUST now?
Jul 02 19:22:55 <snarkypants>	oh makig the sub private is just something mods are doing
Jul 02 19:22:59 <XenoBen>	Is history default?
Jul 02 19:23:03 <creesch>	Yes
Jul 02 19:23:11 <snarkypants>	so reddit admimns didnt make the sub a default, the mods are just making the private? 
Jul 02 19:23:39 <multi-mod>	I knew you and agentlame wouldn't let them slide :P
Jul 02 19:23:41 <PM>	lol history fucking /r/history
Jul 02 19:23:53 <XenoBen>	.mods history
Jul 02 19:23:53 <gonzobot>	(XenoBen) Sorry r/history is set to private and I cannot access it.
Jul 02 19:23:56 <XenoBen>	oh yhea
Jul 02 19:23:57 <XenoBen>	haha
Jul 02 19:23:58 <ManWithoutModem>	<teaearlgraycold> Do y'all think we'll ever get an explanation as to why Victoria left reddit/was kicked out of reddit?
Jul 02 19:23:58 <ManWithoutModem>	she lived in nyc
Jul 02 19:24:10 <redstonehelper>	doubt that's the reason
Jul 02 19:24:11 <Tylzen>	I wonder what would happen if all defaults go private.
Jul 02 19:24:13 <teaearlgraycold>	Really? Oh - so this was a long time coming?
Jul 02 19:24:25 <teaearlgraycold>	But being in NYC is great for a person like herself
Jul 02 19:24:26 <multi-mod>	r/history has gone private in protest of not being able to have historical figures do AMAs
Jul 02 19:24:32 <XenoBen>	all of kn0thing posts are getting downvoted
Jul 02 19:24:40 <teaearlgraycold>	multi-mod, :P
Jul 02 19:24:49 <snarkypants>	if the deafults go private, then a bunch of other subreddits will be on the front page instead
Jul 02 19:24:51 <teaearlgraycold>	XenoBen, I don't think he deserves that
Jul 02 19:24:51 <XenoBen>	so what subs are closed now?
Jul 02 19:24:52 <Nesquik>	.mods gaming
Jul 02 19:24:52 <gonzobot>	(Nesquik) Sorry r/gaming is set to private and I cannot access it.
Jul 02 19:24:59 <redstonehelper>	woah.
Jul 02 19:25:05 <XenoBen>	teaearlgraycold: his recent posts make it sound like a dick
Jul 02 19:25:10 <teaearlgraycold>	snarkypants, ELI5's not going private, neither will DiB
Jul 02 19:25:15 <psdtwk>	snarkypants: that isn't how the frontpage works
Jul 02 19:25:16 <multi-mod>	haha, I guess a lot of mods are getting home from work/school now
Jul 02 19:25:22 <snarkypants>	i mean ALL
Jul 02 19:25:24 <teaearlgraycold>	psdtwk, that's how /r/all works
Jul 02 19:25:25 <snarkypants>	not a users frot page
Jul 02 19:25:27 <XenoBen>	gaming closed now?
Jul 02 19:25:41 <teaearlgraycold>	reddit.com/ is pleb tier
Jul 02 19:25:57 <snarkypants>	there really wont be much of a noticeable impact for the average user that just scrolls around and doens't contribute
Jul 02 19:26:04 <PM>	isn't sporkside the head admins of /r/gaming?

Jul 02 19:27:58 <teaearlgraycold>	I'm pretty sure we're going to have a /r/wow situation
Jul 02 19:28:04 <teaearlgraycold>	The admins will reinstate the subs
Jul 02 19:28:14 <TheAppleFreak>	what subreddits aren't private at this point
Jul 02 19:28:14 <teaearlgraycold>	Remove whoever set it to private (checking the logs)
Jul 02 19:28:23 <tizorres>	tbh kinda dumb to private them idk
Jul 02 19:28:24 <teaearlgraycold>	TheAppleFreak, ELI5 and DIB at least
Jul 02 19:28:25 <snarkypants>	the reason she is no longer employed is confidential, and if they wanted people to know, they would write a blog about it

Jul 02 19:28:26 <Tylzen>	Who are going ot mod them then?
Jul 02 19:28:33 <Tylzen>	Is there going to be a bidding war ? :D 
Jul 02 19:28:39 <teaearlgraycold>	A books mod wanted to go private
Jul 02 19:28:39 <snarkypants>	and if she wanted everybody to know, she would have tweeted it to the world

Jul 02 19:28:54 <coloicito>	Use Tor
Jul 02 19:28:54 <x_minus_one>	but the mods own the sub and can choose what to do with it lolololol

Jul 02 19:54:13 <xlnqeniuz>	we dunno their reasoning
Jul 02 19:54:21 <picflute>	Why not use your subreddits to get the people who are in charge of these decisions fired?
Jul 02 19:54:23 <xlnqeniuz>	but it seems like a bandwagon that everyone is jumping in on
Jul 02 19:54:24 <tizorres>	over reaction much
Jul 02 19:54:41 <XenoBen>	i want to go to bed
Jul 02 19:54:45 <XenoBen>	but this is too juicy
Jul 02 19:54:47 <picflute>	It's something that needs to be done, there are  people who make key decisions on reddit who aren't in touch with their community
Jul 02 19:54:48 <Ivashkin>	I think it's more that there are many many issues with Reddit from a mods POV and this is the straw that broke the camels back
Jul 02 19:55:02 <picflute>	Those people should be held accountable and terminated immediately
Jul 02 19:55:23 <picflute>	But explain to me how the hell is making /r/gaming private going to help out

Jul 02 19:55:44 <Locutus>	In terms of what we get out of this, I really do hope some serious, *useful* mod tools beyond just the modqueue and eldritch horror of modmail emerge

Jul 02 19:56:05 <allthefoxes>	thanks redditbot
Jul 02 19:56:09 <allthefoxes>	/s
Jul 02 19:56:16 <Ivashkin>	picflute, it makes Reddit Inc aware that without users and mods they are people who own an expensive server farm and little else
Jul 02 19:56:21 <x_plus_popcorn>	That's it.  I made /r/x_minus_one private.
Jul 02 19:56:25 <SlyRatchet>	Is there any sort of charter of demands/requests that is floating around?
Jul 02 19:56:27 <allthefoxes>	GASP
Jul 02 19:56:45 <allthefoxes>	SlyRatchet, not really. just a request of "stop being silent non communicating jerks :(
Jul 02 19:56:45 <weeedbot>	I do not support this request.
Jul 02 19:56:49 <SlyRatchet>	Does reddit even own the servers? ;)
Jul 02 19:56:56 <allthefoxes>	no
Jul 02 19:56:59 <allthefoxes>	they use AWS
Jul 02 19:57:05 <Locutus>	"Demands" might be a bit much - but requests, definitely, if anyone wants to pull something together
Jul 02 19:57:17 <rya>	isnt krispykrackers the top mod of askreddit ?
Jul 02 19:57:20 <picflute>	yup
Jul 02 19:57:21 <Makiavel>	yes she is
Jul 02 19:57:23 <rya>	how did she allow dat haha
Jul 02 19:57:26 <SlyRatchet>	haha, so if all of the moderators black out, they're literally just an office with some people in it.
Jul 02 19:57:26 <picflute>	So it's interesting whether or not she noticed yet
Jul 02 19:57:27 <krispykrackers>	I’m not getting into a mod battle with my team
Jul 02 19:57:32 <allthefoxes>	stop pinging kk :(

Jul 02 19:58:05 <rya>	i doubt it
Jul 02 19:58:07 <picflute>	Can we take bets?
Jul 02 19:58:25 <Ivashkin>	a turn of phrase, not a statement of fact. the truth is that reddit is heavily dependent on users who moderate, and they treat us like shit in a lot of cases. I spent a year trying to get help with 4chan bridgading and heard nothing from the admins

Jul 02 20:00:10 <Tylzen>	Locutus, They cannot handle the load.. Stop telling people to go to VOAT, those poor servers :D
Jul 02 20:00:17 <picflute>	And stated that because of this action it fucked up their internal projects
Jul 02 20:00:28 <picflute>	Somehow those internal projects require the whole subredit being shut down.
Jul 02 20:00:32 <Flashynuff>	/r/listentothis has closed submissions
Jul 02 20:00:56 <Locutus>	Ivashkin: I wonder what could actually be done to help in that respect? Hiring more community managers? Allowing mods access to some level of referral URLs?
Jul 02 20:01:03 <MillenniumFalc0n>	closed submissions? that's jsut going to confuse people
Jul 02 20:01:14 <Ivashkin>	why does /r/upvoted contain Nigerian prince spam?
Jul 02 20:01:29 <picflute>	We need to make this more significant, shut down /r/gonewild
Jul 02 20:01:36 <ManWithoutModem>	<teaearlgraycold> But he doesn't deal with the admin-mail shityeah he does
Jul 02 20:01:49 <rya>	i hope r/gonewild doesnt go private
Jul 02 20:01:50 <teaearlgraycold>	ManWithoutModem, well then
Jul 02 20:01:51 <Makiavel>	no picflute, don't do that
Jul 02 20:01:53 <kerovon>	picflute: it was because for about 5 hours, we were getting told "Its okay. Everything is fine, jsut email us", not getting responses to the email, and even after they started responding (once we went private), they still have ducked all of the questions we had.
Jul 02 20:02:00 <picflute>	I'd love for more analytics on wiki pages
Jul 02 20:02:09 <picflute>	Like traffic stats that we get for subreddits
Jul 02 20:02:14 <multi-mod>	that OOTL person is going to get themselves auto shadow banned if they start mass mailing subreddits
Jul 02 20:02:14 <Ivashkin>	Locutus, ideally yes, they need community admins. a layer between the admins and the mods
Jul 02 20:02:26 <Tylzen>	Can we shut down r/lounge?  :D
Jul 02 20:02:26 <teaearlgraycold>	OOTL?
Jul 02 20:02:38 <multi-mod>	out of the loop
Jul 02 20:02:43 <picflute>	Did you really expect responses on Day 0?
Jul 02 20:02:48 <teaearlgraycold>	They're modmailing?
Jul 02 20:02:51 <teaearlgraycold>	What exactly
Jul 02 20:02:56 <XenoBen>	whats the full list of closed subs?
Jul 02 20:03:02 <picflute>	Like fromwhat information was said about the incident do you really think it's going to work on the opening day

Jul 02 20:03:22 <Locutus>	XenoBen: https://voat.co/v/MeanwhileOnReddit is keeping a running total. You can almost see them bouncing up and down with glee.
Jul 02 20:03:22 <teaearlgraycold>	XenoBen, and CJ too if you coutn that
Jul 02 20:03:24 <Locutus>	when it's accessible
Jul 02 20:03:26 <Tylzen>	picflute, Imagine if she had been in an accident instead.. They had no backup
Jul 02 20:03:43 <multi-mod>	I just got a modmail from him, but I think you can get auto shadow banned if you send out too many identical modmails
Jul 02 20:03:46 <picflute>	Yea no shit but what exactly did you really expect to get out on day 0 of this change.
Jul 02 20:04:13 <SlyRatchet>	Being realistic, it's going to take several days to get anything out of the reddit admins.
Jul 02 20:04:23 <picflute>	So why is this such shocking news?
Jul 02 20:04:23 <Tylzen>	picflute, No, but at least some compentent plan.. Not creating an email hours after to handle the sudden panic.
Jul 02 20:04:37 <Locutus>	We'll probably hear a proper response within a day. 
Jul 02 20:04:45 <kerovon>	I would expect them to respond to questions.  Even when the question was "Can you give us the contact of the person so we can finish finalizing the AMA", the response was basically "No, stay out of it. Trust us."
Jul 02 20:04:48 <Locutus>	At the very least, "we're working on something"
Jul 02 20:04:48 <picflute>	It took me almost 24 hours to get back from an admin to verify that I was doxxed by a user.
Jul 02 20:04:49 <Rlight>	.>tfw studying for the bar all day, come back to reddit, and everything is exploding
Jul 02 20:04:53 <SlyRatchet>	I think it'll be some sort of vague, statement
Jul 02 20:05:12 <picflute>	Do you seriously think that they'd be ready to respond to everything day 0?
Jul 02 20:05:24 <Locutus>	"Every Man is Responsible for his own Soul"
Jul 02 20:05:25 <Tylzen>	picflute, Yeah, but this is about one of the largest subreddits, that generates a lot of traffic for reddit, one would have thought they had some plan, if their employee would suddenly stop being there.
Jul 02 20:05:26 <SlyRatchet>	yeah. I know when we removed two moderators from the /r/europe team due to public pressure it took literally days of constant pressure on the mod team, (in addition to years of complaining before that point)
Jul 02 20:05:58 <XenoBen>	SlyRatchet: what happened with the recent problems
Jul 02 20:06:00 <picflute>	OK, but you're ignoring past behavior and are assuming that everyone was aware of this change when that clearly wasn't the case. 
Jul 02 20:06:00 <XenoBen>	with the french dude
Jul 02 20:06:26 <Tylzen>	picflute, Sure, but still doesn't change the fact that Reddit from the top, made a clusterfuck out of this.
Jul 02 20:07:07 <Tylzen>	picflute, If your organisation cannot handle the sudden disappearing of an employee, being that the person was let go, in an accident or suddenly ill.. Is just bad management and planning.
Jul 02 20:07:18 <SlyRatchet>	Xenoben nothing? He's an excellent moderator, but it takes a lot of time to adjust to moderating 400,000 people in a politically charged in environment. We're doing a post mortem on that weird french language mega thread though. Talk to me about it in a different IRC chat though, because we're getting off topic
Jul 02 20:07:26 <picflute>	But can you expect them to respond to it same day?
Jul 02 20:07:43 <picflute>	If they didn't respond to you 24 hours later then I'd make a fuss
Jul 02 20:07:46 <Ivashkin>	SlyRatchet, we're people do this in our spare time for "fun", they are a very valuable company whose main business is running a website
Jul 02 20:08:03 <picflute>	But I'm reasonable I know that shit takes time and I rather get a proper response then a rushed one.
Jul 02 20:08:05 <Tylzen>	picflute, Yeah, when they had people flying to NY to do AMA, and the agent told the mod team about the news.
Jul 02 20:08:13 <kerovon>	picflute; The biggest thing is that /r/science was ignored through 5 different contact methods for 4 hours. After we went private, we actually got them to pay attention. 
Jul 02 20:08:22 <picflute>	Wow, 4 hours ?
Jul 02 20:08:37 <Tylzen>	Which is a long time if you have AMAs planned with client.
Jul 02 20:08:43 <Tylzen>	clients*
Jul 02 20:09:02 <Tylzen>	"Hey you were suppose to get help from this person, who is no longer here.. And the company hasn't responded to us"
Jul 02 20:09:18 <picflute>	That company tends to take a day to get responses.
Jul 02 20:09:29 <Tylzen>	Which is still bad management.
Jul 02 20:09:40 <picflute>	I find that better then how some mods operate on the site
Jul 02 20:09:55 <Tylzen>	There are certian things that are priotized higher than others.
Jul 02 20:10:11 <snarkypants>	people that mod for free arent a priority
Jul 02 20:10:26 <Tylzen>	I am on the board of a national organisation, and I handle some of our communication.. And some regular mails I can let wait for a couple of hours or even some days..
Jul 02 20:10:42 <Tylzen>	But if something in the organisation broke, or someone had to leave their post, I wouldn't fucking wait hours.
Jul 02 20:10:44 <picflute>	Great, butlet's look at what we're dealing with here.
Jul 02 20:10:46 <Tylzen>	I would be on the phone, to fix it.
Jul 02 20:11:01 <picflute>	You're asking for contact information for people correct?
Jul 02 20:11:14 <SlyRatchet>	Ivashkin true, but I think the fundamentals of both groups being a fairly tight nit organisation responding to a sort of public relations crisis. I think that means the time scales of response can be fairly similar
Jul 02 20:11:16 <Tylzen>	IAMA breaking down is bad PR for Reddit.
Jul 02 20:11:25 <picflute>	IAmA community didn't break down, the mods did.
Jul 02 20:11:35 <SlyRatchet>	Are there any IAMA and AskReddit mods here?
Jul 02 20:11:58 <Tylzen>	picflute, Have you read what Karmanaut wrote about what it meant to have Victoria removed?

Jul 02 20:12:16 <gonzobot>	(Tylzen) Why has R/Iama been set to private? : OutOfTheLoop - 2,031 comments, 5,602 points - chickenmagic, 7h ago
Jul 02 20:12:21 <picflute>	I am well aware of what was said
Jul 02 20:12:42 <Ivashkin>	SlyRatchet, we don't have meeting rooms, email, IM, conference call lines and day jobs specifically to deal with these problems 
Jul 02 20:12:45 <picflute>	But do you really think that it'sokay to shut down multiple sitesbecause ofit?
Jul 02 20:12:50 <Tylzen>	And you still think it isn't a break down, if you remove an essential part of how IAMA works, and not having a backup ready.
Jul 02 20:12:55 <picflute>	How many subs actively use Victoria and her free service?
Jul 02 20:12:56 <snarkypants>	isnt that called a strike?
Jul 02 20:13:07 <snarkypants>	its a moderator unofficial union strike
Jul 02 20:13:13 <picflute>	Does every IAmA require her attention?
Jul 02 20:13:15 <Tylzen>	picflute, The rest of the subs are sympathizing.
Jul 02 20:13:28 <kerovon>	iama, /r/science, /r/books, /r/music all used her heavily that I know of 
Jul 02 20:13:42 <kerovon>	movies used her I believe
Jul 02 20:13:53 <Nesquik>	she must feel so loved right now
Jul 02 20:13:54 <rya>	man its been a long time since i saw karmanaut getting upvoted so much in his own acct
Jul 02 20:13:55 <teaearlgraycold>	Books and music aren't down yet though
Jul 02 20:13:56 <snarkypants>	its what happens when you employ thousands of people to curate your content and work for reddit gold and stickers
Jul 02 20:13:56 <SlyRatchet>	Ivashkin, true, but we were in almost constant contact throughout that crisis, even if we didn't use Skype. The time it took for action to be had was based on our feelings of the crisis, not our ability to communicate or otherwise
Jul 02 20:13:58 <Tylzen>	But I guess it is better to go back to Rampant IAMAs
Jul 02 20:14:08 <rya>	soooooo lonnnnnngggggggggg
Jul 02 20:14:17 <SlyRatchet>	snarkypants an official moderator's union would be an awesome idea though. I nominate myself
Jul 02 20:14:17 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Did you ever watch Rampant?
Jul 02 20:14:23 <picflute>	Wow 1 bad AmA and hundreds that were fine withouther
Jul 02 20:14:28 <teaearlgraycold>	SlyRatchet, let's do it
Jul 02 20:14:33 <Tylzen>	SlyRatchet, Nominate yourself to be a union? :D
Jul 02 20:14:36 <picflute>	And there were multiple ones that operated without her that did fine.
Jul 02 20:14:46 <Ivashkin>	but it needs an old school union name
Jul 02 20:14:47 <Tylzen>	o_O
Jul 02 20:14:53 <sarahbotts>	the fuck did I miss
Jul 02 20:14:59 <snarkypants>	we are forming a union
Jul 02 20:15:03 <teaearlgraycold>	sarahbotts, lol
Jul 02 20:15:05 <SlyRatchet>	Call me Moderator's Union now. You may petition to join me and be absorbed into my contiousness
Jul 02 20:15:06 <Tylzen>	picflute, You cannot see the major difference in quality before Victoria to whilst she was there.
Jul 02 20:15:07 <teaearlgraycold>	Join the party
Jul 02 20:15:22 <sarahbotts>	teaearlgraycold come back and 4 mods are added and other shit is on fire
Jul 02 20:15:26 <Tylzen>	sarahbotts, Victoria fired/let go, a lot of defaults have gone dark

Jul 02 20:15:38 <snarkypants>	lol crappydesign
Jul 02 20:15:38 <picflute>	I see the difference, but I fail to see why her departure would honestly affect how a majority of those subreddit operate
Jul 02 20:15:39 <sarahbotts>	wait really

Jul 02 20:18:39 <XenoBen>	sarahbotts: priv lol
Jul 02 20:18:50 <sarahbotts>	huh?
Jul 02 20:18:50 <picflute>	kill modmail and change it to something else
Jul 02 20:18:54 <x_plus_popcorn>	new search page fucking sucks
Jul 02 20:18:55 <sarahbotts>	>We get that losing Victoria has a significant impact on the way you manage your community. I'd really like to understand how we can help solve these problems, because I know r/IAMA thrived before her and will thrive after.
Jul 02 20:18:57 <Locutus>	SlyRatchet: Modmail. 
Jul 02 20:19:05 <sarahbotts>	that comment though
Jul 02 20:19:12 <Tylzen>	sarahbotts, Yup, from Alexis :D 
Jul 02 20:19:14 <blueshiftlabs>	Make modmail not suck every ass in the Western Hemisphere
Jul 02 20:19:17 <Ivashkin>	modmail, shitty mod tools, not enough admin level help when needed
Jul 02 20:19:19 <x_plus_popcorn>	I want redditmade back
Jul 02 20:19:23 <Tylzen>	sarahbotts, We will do fine, they created ama@reddit.com :D
Jul 02 20:19:27 <picflute>	Actually I'dlike it if we could downloada full archive of modmail
Jul 02 20:19:38 <SlyRatchet>	So, I think the message I'm getting here is, we don't like mod mail, right? xP
Jul 02 20:19:46 <Locutus>	^
Jul 02 20:20:15 <Ivashkin>	you need modtools to even begin to make it usable
Jul 02 20:20:16 <sarahbotts>	how long goes it take to rework modmail if they have a dedicated engineer for it though
Jul 02 20:20:17 <picflute>	If they offered an archive download I'd suck it up and use it forver

Jul 02 20:20:33 <x316nuts>	I started drinking 
Jul 02 20:20:35 <x316nuts>	So 
Jul 02 20:20:37 <x_plus_popcorn>	you know, obama did an ama once
Jul 02 20:20:38 <joyouscacophony>	You just finding all this out alienth?
Jul 02 20:20:38 <Tylzen>	Does anyone have the IAMA app on their phones? What does it do now?
Jul 02 20:20:40 <x_plus_popcorn>	THANKS OBAMA
Jul 02 20:20:47 <x_plus_popcorn>	Tylzen: it just hangs while loading
Jul 02 20:20:47 <alienth>	joyouscacophony: nah, i've been watching it from a distance.
Jul 02 20:20:50 <multi-mod>	In the morning I take a shower and get dressed in a suit before I sit down to moderate each day. All I'm asking for is complementary warm hand towels and champaign to make my day brighter.
Jul 02 20:20:50 <SlyRatchet>	if we could quickly load the entire mod mail page then we could just use alt F, but we can't EVEN do taht
Jul 02 20:20:51 <joyouscacophony>	beer of choice x316nuts
Jul 02 20:20:52 <alienth>	Tylzen: it shows nothing
Jul 02 20:20:56 <Locutus>	But, eh. 1) Perhaps hiring some more community managers, and 2) Better mod tools - we shouldn't have to rely on a forest of extensions to run a large sub. 
Jul 02 20:21:02 <Tylzen>	Not even the private message.
Jul 02 20:21:08 <sarahbotts>	I thought there were more community managers hired, just silently
Jul 02 20:21:17 <x316nuts>	Chocolate rain. When in doubt drink a 19% beer 
Jul 02 20:21:18 <sarahbotts>	was there an announcement for lordvinyl and others?
Jul 02 20:21:20 <sarahbotts>	I don't remember seeing one
Jul 02 20:21:33 <joyouscacophony>	I may dive into my cellard w00tstout tonight
Jul 02 20:21:43 <joyouscacophony>	It seems to be a good night for it
Jul 02 20:21:50 <x316nuts>	That's a good beer for sure. Third batch us coming out now 
Jul 02 20:21:52 <picflute>	Man I feel bad for that dude,
Jul 02 20:22:00 <joyouscacophony>	I missed the 2nd
Jul 02 20:22:09 <x_plus_popcorn>	I mean, they didn't design the app with it loading a private sub in mind
Jul 02 20:22:10 <picflute>	SRC literally has a hate boner for him
Jul 02 20:22:16 <x_plus_popcorn>	i'm surprised it even honors the private setting
Jul 02 20:22:32 <alienth>	x_plus_popcorn: if it didn't then anyone could get around the private setting via API
Jul 02 20:22:38 <gilgamesh>	https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/194043
Jul 02 20:22:39 <alienth>	since the iama app just consumes the API
Jul 02 20:22:45 <x_plus_popcorn>	I should rephrase that
Jul 02 20:22:55 <x_plus_popcorn>	I'm pleasantly surprised it doesn't use some weird hack

Jul 02 20:25:08 <joyouscacophony>	It'll get better if more defaults shutter up x_plus_popcorn
Jul 02 20:25:11 <Tylzen>	multi-mod, I like that.. Self-inflicted silent treatment.
Jul 02 20:25:26 <picflute>	You also seem to prefer complaining about it more then finding a solution yourself
Jul 02 20:25:29 <x_plus_popcorn>	email and ask why iama is closed
Jul 02 20:25:37 <multi-mod>	alienth, where are you in reddit's time of need?
Jul 02 20:25:42 <Tylzen>	What kind of solution could I possible find :D
Jul 02 20:25:49 <x_plus_popcorn>	stackexchange
Jul 02 20:25:58 <picflute>	None because you've made it clear you're incapable of finding one out yourself.

Jul 02 20:26:09 <alienth>	multi-mod: i've got new things to worry about nowadays.

Jul 02 20:26:36 <Tylzen>	I cannot fix how the heads of Reddit run their company.
Jul 02 20:26:50 <multi-mod>	he's working at stack exchange, but redditing all day
Jul 02 20:26:50 <picflute>	You can fix the situation with AmA's and attempt to contact them directly.
Jul 02 20:26:51 <joyouscacophony>	alienth: Stealth Voat agent!
Jul 02 20:26:52 <alienth>	been going well :) just got back from denver where we setup a new cage at a DC
Jul 02 20:26:54 <snarkypants>	well the solution would be to simply reopen the subs, and whenever somebody wants to schedule an AMA, send them to the admin contact link.
Jul 02 20:27:13 <x_plus_popcorn>	https://i.imgur.com/GVFbI3L.webm
Jul 02 20:27:22 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Yeah, but he asked me to find a solution, and I cannot reopen any of those subreddits :D

Jul 02 20:27:37 <rya>	do we have a mod union ?
Jul 02 20:27:43 <rya>	it wud be fun
Jul 02 20:27:43 <alienth>	this type of situation has no 'solution'. it only has an outcome.
Jul 02 20:27:55 <alienth>	the outcome remains to be seen. i can't iamgine it being positive, tho.
Jul 02 20:27:55 <Tylzen>	#modtalk is the closest we have to a union :D
Jul 02 20:28:03 <rya>	oh i c u r back in the reigns alienth

Jul 02 20:28:16 <alienth>	ello ello
Jul 02 20:28:33 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I'm really worried this is just going to make the walls between mods and admins taller
Jul 02 20:28:39 <greenduch>	what sort of outcome do you forsee, wise alienth ?
Jul 02 20:28:44 <rya>	any thoughts on the new developments alienth ? i c everyone is playing the private hide and seek game
Jul 02 20:28:46 <teaearlgraycold>	Everyone will end up more and more salty
Jul 02 20:28:52 <snarkypants>	making the subs private doesnt really help
Jul 02 20:28:58 <picflute>	Or forget about it after a week and not care
Jul 02 20:29:16 <blueshiftlabs>	teaearlgraycold: too late for that, everyone's already saltier than Lot's wife
Jul 02 20:29:21 <alienth>	greenduch: wellllll, i don't think anything that reddit can do or promise is going to make the mods who feel like they're being ignored feel better.
Jul 02 20:29:26 <Piemonkey>	so
Jul 02 20:29:29 <Locutus>	What do the subs in question actually want to see as a result, in concrete terms? Some codified requests would help clarify things.
Jul 02 20:29:29 <Piemonkey>	i just got home
Jul 02 20:29:29 <weeedbot>	I do not support this request.

Jul 02 20:29:56 <sarahbotts>	I can't spell, dammit
Jul 02 20:29:59 <rya>	well thats always alienth 
Jul 02 20:30:00 <rya>	haha
Jul 02 20:30:00 <SlyRatchet>	qIR
Jul 02 20:30:03 <SlyRatchet>	wot
Jul 02 20:30:06 <sarahbotts>	Oh yeah, we've gotten them in a bunch of my subs
Jul 02 20:30:07 <x316nuts>	!mods 316cats 
Jul 02 20:30:07 <redditBot>	r/316cats has 8 mods: 316nuts, A_Cylon_Raider, stopscopiesme, cupcake1713, lolsail, redtaboo, familynight, and statball
Jul 02 20:30:08 <sarahbotts>	.flip allthefoxes
Jul 02 20:30:08 <gonzobot>	( ﾉ♉︵♉ ）ﾉ ︵ sǝxoɟǝɥʇןןɐ
Jul 02 20:30:12 <alienth>	so, i suspect the subreddits will stay private until cooler heads prevail, or until the community pendulum swigns against the mods and they resign out of exasperation. (at least in some cases)
Jul 02 20:30:12 <x316nuts>	Yis 
Jul 02 20:30:16 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, It would make reddit less desirable, and generate less traffic and less money, which the heads of Reddit understand :D

Jul 02 20:30:29 <rya>	anyone with me ?
Jul 02 20:30:29 <Tylzen>	!mods horses
Jul 02 20:30:29 <redditBot>	r/horses has 5 mods: naphthoylindole, BrittanyGhoul, jasmin356, AtomicPenny, and BotWatchman
Jul 02 20:30:33 <sarahbotts>	hatechu
Jul 02 20:30:36 <alienth>	maybe indefinitely in some cases, or until they come up for grabs by /r/redditrequest.
Jul 02 20:30:40 <snarkypants>	reddit can just designate different subs as defaults
Jul 02 20:30:51 <Locutus>	Including IAmA?
Jul 02 20:30:52 <SlyRatchet>	a country subreddit went private???
Jul 02 20:30:54 <Locutus>	That's awkward
Jul 02 20:30:55 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Sure, but still hard to make them as popular.
Jul 02 20:30:56 <alienth>	snarkypants: iama is a bit tricky on that.
Jul 02 20:30:57 <picflute>	wait which
Jul 02 20:30:59 *	gilgamesh ouch
Jul 02 20:31:00 <rya>	lol spain
Jul 02 20:31:05 <x_plus_popcorn>	rya: i privated /r/x_minus_one
Jul 02 20:31:08 <picflute>	o7
Jul 02 20:31:08 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Also IAMA has an official app :D
Jul 02 20:31:09 <rya>	haha
Jul 02 20:31:10 <alienth>	snarkypants: gaming as well. there is so much history that is linked to which is now inaccessible.
Jul 02 20:31:12 <Obliviater>	God too much drama today
Jul 02 20:31:14 <rya>	gud gud x_plus_popcorn 
Jul 02 20:31:14 <sarahbotts>	can you reddit request private subs with active mods though?
Jul 02 20:31:17 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, if there was some kind of delivered update on modmail I suppose some of the subs would open up immediately
Jul 02 20:31:18 <Tylzen>	snarkypants, Can we apply to make Modeltrains a default :D
Jul 02 20:31:21 <snarkypants>	sure
Jul 02 20:31:24 <Tylzen>	Woohoo
Jul 02 20:31:26 <gilgamesh>	sarahbotts> can you reddit request private subs with active mods though? no
Jul 02 20:31:33 <SlyRatchet>	sarahbotts you can request it, but they won't grant your request ;P
Jul 02 20:31:39 <SlyRatchet>	it's a private sub, not an inactive one
Jul 02 20:31:39 <rya>	yea i dont think u can request them
Jul 02 20:31:39 <snarkypants>	also I gave /u/noeatnosleep /r/askmeanything
Jul 02 20:31:54 <rya>	only if the mods r inactive
Jul 02 20:31:56 <Tylzen>	I should mail ama@reddit.com "Dear Reddit, since IAMA is private, can you please make r/modeltrains a default instead.. We don't need any help from you."
Jul 02 20:32:06 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: maybe, but I don't think there is much of an update to provide on modmail.
Jul 02 20:32:19 <alienth>	so i'm doubtful that will happen
Jul 02 20:32:20 <SlyRatchet>	hahaha
Jul 02 20:32:25 <picflute>	Can't you just scrap the whole system and introduce something similar to reddit live with it?
Jul 02 20:32:32 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, are you saying you think it doesn't need much improvement? or that it's too bad to fix
Jul 02 20:32:55 <rya>	https://www.reddit.com/r/BooU/
Jul 02 20:32:56 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: no no, i'm saying that it eneds a huge amount of improvemenmt, which has been said many, many times. saying it again won't calm anyone down.
Jul 02 20:33:01 <EvilNight>	god damn it I knew this was going to snowball this morning
Jul 02 20:33:03 <rya>	for booing admins!
Jul 02 20:33:17 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, that's why I said code needs to be shipped
Jul 02 20:33:48 <alienth>	yeah, gotta get someone to work on it first. (i'm not sure if anyone is)
Jul 02 20:33:53 <EvilNight>	admins, kindly remind corporate that the mods wrote and control most of the bots that keep these places running, so if they are thinking of reaching for the banhammer, think twice
Jul 02 20:33:56 <teaearlgraycold>	Something - at least make modmail chains threaded and allow for the remove button to actually do something
Jul 02 20:34:02 <teaearlgraycold>	Threading is just a bit of JS
Jul 02 20:34:23 <multi-mod>	I sort of started in the lets wait and see camp this morning.. I think kn0thing was really the reason I switched so quickly.
Jul 02 20:34:24 <rya>	do u think the admins even noticed all the defaults privatized ?
Jul 02 20:34:25 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I've been wondering if the lack of dev. on modmail was a monetary issue
Jul 02 20:34:44 <multi-mod>	rya, I think KK noticed, which is why she noped out of chat before
Jul 02 20:34:49 <rya>	lol
Jul 02 20:34:51 <x_plus_popcorn>	This is truly a great time to be alive.
Jul 02 20:34:52 <greenduch>	no its lack of management
Jul 02 20:35:02 <snarkypants>	it is a lack of funds
Jul 02 20:35:05 <rya>	i feel bad for KK :(
Jul 02 20:35:09 <snarkypants>	they need more venture capital injected
Jul 02 20:35:15 <multi-mod>	btw, in before #modtalk leak
Jul 02 20:35:23 <rya>	i cud inject it too
Jul 02 20:35:25 <rya>	.lenny

Jul 02 20:35:47 <x_plus_popcorn>	lol
Jul 02 20:35:59 <SlyRatchet>	Someone must have realised something is up by *now
Jul 02 20:36:09 <Locutus>	Even integrating some stuff like Toolbox a bit better would be a huge help, generally. 
Jul 02 20:36:13 <rya>	i think the admins will be saying "this is the internet .. it will be back to normal by tmw"
Jul 02 20:36:14 <SlyRatchet>	Also, can you guys access this link? It's the list of demands so far https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmZVV7i0aWfDnzyrFlPVBRpl5SUojlhUvb5COElZIYU/edit?usp=sharing

Jul 02 20:37:17 <snarkypants>	lol they are not going t give mods access to ip information to determine sockuppetry, this isn't wikipedia
Jul 02 20:37:19 <sarahbotts>	lol modtalk, home of the mod bitching
Jul 02 20:37:22 <sarahbotts>	:P
Jul 02 20:37:23 <teaearlgraycold>	I feel like if reddit took more pull requests this wouldnt' be such a big issue
Jul 02 20:37:40 <teaearlgraycold>	snarkypants, they can give IP has info
Jul 02 20:37:41 <picflute>	Damn
Jul 02 20:37:45 <teaearlgraycold>	hash*
Jul 02 20:37:50 <picflute>	What the fuck is going to happen to SubredditSimulator
Jul 02 20:37:51 <snarkypants>	its a vilatin of privacy, they are not
Jul 02 20:37:51 <SlyRatchet>	I mention in the same bullet point that there are other things they could do
Jul 02 20:37:52 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: nope, you can't. becauuuse.
Jul 02 20:37:53 <alienth>	ipv32
Jul 02 20:37:56 <alienth>	err
Jul 02 20:37:56 <snarkypants>	*violation
Jul 02 20:37:56 <alienth>	ipv4
Jul 02 20:38:03 <alienth>	ip hashing isn't viable
Jul 02 20:38:06 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth?
Jul 02 20:38:07 <alienth>	due to the small address space
Jul 02 20:38:11 <xlnqeniuz>	k
Jul 02 20:38:18 <snarkypants>	an employee can have access to it, but an employee isn't going to hand it out to a mod or another user
Jul 02 20:38:19 <xlnqeniuz>	./r/videos private aswell
Jul 02 20:38:22 <xlnqeniuz>	how many do we have to go?
Jul 02 20:38:23 <coloicito>	really?
Jul 02 20:38:24 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, hash the IP + salth with subreddit specific info
Jul 02 20:38:26 <xlnqeniuz>	ya
Jul 02 20:38:27 <kerovon>	modmail from reporters.  How wonderful.
Jul 02 20:38:33 <teaearlgraycold>	Stuff we can't see
Jul 02 20:38:40 <snarkypants>	or just hire more employees to handle that kind of activity
Jul 02 20:38:52 <snarkypants>	but to hire more employees they need more money
Jul 02 20:38:53 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: that'd require a modification to the privacy policy.
Jul 02 20:38:54 <picflute>	Journlalists should be forced to through basic behavior training
Jul 02 20:39:02 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: which would need to be presented to the community
Jul 02 20:39:09 <blueshiftlabs>	I like the sub-specific salted hash idea 
Jul 02 20:39:10 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: i'd say good luck getting the community to swallow that one :/
Jul 02 20:39:14 <x_plus_popcorn>	imagine the butthurt
Jul 02 20:39:15 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I'm sure - just an idea I've been tossing around with other mods
Jul 02 20:39:16 <rya>	ahaha
Jul 02 20:39:16 <snarkypants>	so they need to get better at selling advertising, or get more investors
Jul 02 20:39:19 <rya>	a live thread

Jul 02 20:39:23 <rya>	this is great
Jul 02 20:39:24 <kerovon>	Honestly, after looking at where this person writes, I'm thinking that the DailyDot would be more reputable.
Jul 02 20:39:27 <SlyRatchet>	sub specific salted hash idea?..
Jul 02 20:39:40 <picflute>	DD Reputable?
Jul 02 20:39:45 <picflute>	Which section?
Jul 02 20:39:46 <blueshiftlabs>	for giving mods access to IP addrs
Jul 02 20:39:54 <snarkypants>	thats private information though
Jul 02 20:39:55 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, if it's subreddit or even thread specific then it's not so dangerous IMO.
Jul 02 20:40:00 <snarkypants>	its not going to happen
Jul 02 20:40:02 <NumberTwoFan>	krispy couldn't handle us
Jul 02 20:40:19 <kerovon>	Compared to this "journalists" website? Their top story is "Forget Kim K: Each of these 31 girls have a better butt"
Jul 02 20:40:27 <XenoBen>	there goes videos
Jul 02 20:40:29 <x316nuts>	Okay 
Jul 02 20:40:30 <teaearlgraycold>	snarkypants, it's not info - it's just pseudo-randomness based off of the IP in some way
Jul 02 20:40:31 <NumberTwoFan>	we need alienth to make an announcement post to calm us all down
Jul 02 20:40:39 <blueshiftlabs>	snarkypants: properly implemeneted, all you could do with it
Jul 02 20:40:43 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: dangerous or not, it is a significant change regarding how the company handles private user info. giving non-employees teh ability to determine what accounts share the same IP requires some thought on privacy.
Jul 02 20:40:44 <snarkypants>	sockpuppetry isn't against the rules
Jul 02 20:40:45 <x316nuts>	So which out of the loop mod to I bribe to have flair mention /r/316cats 
Jul 02 20:40:48 <Locutus>	XenoBen: I think the site's net comment quality just improved a bit.
Jul 02 20:40:58 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: not saying it isn't worth considering, but it is certainly not trivial
Jul 02 20:41:16 <SlyRatchet>	Ok I am changing the IP request thing to something more vague.
Jul 02 20:41:18 <alienth>	NumberTwoFan: i no longer work there, so i'm kinda unable to help out
Jul 02 20:41:30 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I can appreciate that. But there is precedence in this matter. IRC gives out that information (hashed IPs), different forum software does the same
Jul 02 20:41:31 <SlyRatchet>	Don't forget you can leave comments on the doc itself
Jul 02 20:41:35 <snarkypants>	noeatnosleep|shop, you need to get /r/askmeanything going
Jul 02 20:41:39 <NumberTwoFan>	should have made yourself an approved submitter before you left
Jul 02 20:41:39 <XenoBen>	recently, reddit is going down a v steep sloap
Jul 02 20:41:49 <x_plus_popcorn>	how about automatically spamfilter stuff from a banned user's blatant alt?
Jul 02 20:41:54 <XenoBen>	SlyRatchet: whats happening?
Jul 02 20:41:57 <Ivashkin>	I want a ban function that bans the IP without us having to see it
Jul 02 20:42:11 <blueshiftlabs>	^
Jul 02 20:42:14 <SlyRatchet>	XenoBen I'm making a list of requests from the moderators to the admins https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmZVV7i0aWfDnzyrFlPVBRpl5SUojlhUvb5COElZIYU/edit?usp=sharing
Jul 02 20:42:16 <blueshiftlabs>	that alone would be useful
Jul 02 20:42:24 <Ivashkin>	no more people saying "I have 20 accounts, you banned number 3"
Jul 02 20:42:25 <XenoBen>	ah ok
Jul 02 20:42:35 <blueshiftlabs>	I have massive issues with ban evasion
Jul 02 20:42:36 <alienth>	Ivashkin: IP banning tends to not work well on reddit. like.. it works OK.. but it is insanely easy to work around for most people. also, a lot of folks are coming from dorm rooms, or behind LSN where 10,000 people share the same IP.
Jul 02 20:42:53 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, large universities don't NAT
Jul 02 20:43:01 <teaearlgraycold>	Neither of the two near me do
Jul 02 20:43:07 <INeedAnswers123>	r/videos went private btw
Jul 02 20:43:09 <Ivashkin>	I know, on a php forum I restorted to browser fingerprinting
Jul 02 20:43:12 <x_plus_popcorn>	https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes
Jul 02 20:43:14 <teaearlgraycold>	It's way easier to blame someone for torrenting without NATing
Jul 02 20:43:18 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: i ran into plenty that did while i was at reddit, because we'd limit one IP and an entire university would be emailing us.
Jul 02 20:43:25 <XenoBen>	my entire accommodation block all came out 1 ip
Jul 02 20:43:28 <Ivashkin>	pain in the ass, but Apache wouldn't even serve certain users a 404
Jul 02 20:43:28 <alienth>	often because some student tried scraping us
Jul 02 20:43:37 <Locutus>	Even fingerprinting can be got around trivially. So awkward.
Jul 02 20:43:45 <gilgamesh>	Obliviater, please redirect all /r/videos traffic to /r/video
Jul 02 20:43:45 <x_plus_popcorn>	.mods videos
Jul 02 20:43:45 <gonzobot>	(x_plus_popcorn) Sorry r/videos is set to private and I cannot access it.
Jul 02 20:43:56 <Obliviater>	Wtf
Jul 02 20:43:58 <Obliviater>	I didn't vote
Jul 02 20:44:00 <Obliviater>	wtf
Jul 02 20:44:05 <x316nuts>	Too late 
Jul 02 20:44:05 <GuitarFreak>	I didn't even see a vote
Jul 02 20:44:05 <noeatnosleep|shop>	Ok, snarkypants 
Jul 02 20:44:06 <Obliviater>	seriously
Jul 02 20:44:07 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I'd assume smaller ones - like less than 4k. Interesting to hear that though
Jul 02 20:44:09 <EvilNight>	lol
Jul 02 20:44:09 <noeatnosleep|shop>	Will soon
Jul 02 20:44:10 <XenoBen>	overruied i guess
Jul 02 20:44:12 <Obliviater>	wtf is this 
Jul 02 20:44:17 <Obliviater>	This isn't cool
Jul 02 20:44:31 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: anyways, don't let me dissuade you from thinking of these things. just trying to provide context on reddit's POV regarding those things.
Jul 02 20:44:34 <x316nuts>	Hey when this leaks eventually to paste bin please subscribe to /r/316cats 
Jul 02 20:44:40 <x316nuts>	Thank you 
Jul 02 20:44:45 <snarkypants>	also /r/modeltrains
Jul 02 20:44:56 <Kreius>	and /r/shittyshowerthoughts thx
Jul 02 20:45:03 <Obliviater>	@guitarfreak may I speak to you in a DM over irc?
Jul 02 20:45:04 <XenoBen>	and dont forget to check out my meme collection
Jul 02 20:45:08 <picflute>	im waiting for r/funny to shut down
Jul 02 20:45:17 <XenoBen>	i want funny and pics
Jul 02 20:45:20 <XenoBen>	to clear frontpage
Jul 02 20:45:25 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, thanks. But do these ideas even have a slight chance at fruition? It's one thing to hear that they're not horrible and worth some thought. Another entirely to see it leave IRC or /r/defaultmods even for a second
Jul 02 20:45:25 <x316nuts>	I voted no in pics 
Jul 02 20:45:28 <joyouscacophony>	Like they'd do anything to benefit the site
Jul 02 20:45:38 <x316nuts>	You whiny fucks 
Jul 02 20:45:44 <joyouscacophony>	:)
Jul 02 20:45:49 <XenoBen>	pics, funny and aa. frontpage will be epic.
Jul 02 20:46:00 <joyouscacophony>	There'd be nothing left
Jul 02 20:46:07 <x316nuts>	Sure they make alllll of their  employees move to sf and no one cares about that 
Jul 02 20:46:14 <snarkypants>	i think reddit should just hire more staff that is responsible for curating content and managing default subs
Jul 02 20:46:17 <SlyRatchet>	When this leaks: Hi mum!
Jul 02 20:46:23 <alienth>	teaearlgraycold: not being there anymore I can't say for certain. i can say that anything which may involve the privacy of users is going to have to be presented to the community as a whole, which is an extremely difficult sell (as i'm sure you're aware)
Jul 02 20:46:24 <Relic2279>	Videos goes dark
Jul 02 20:46:24 <x316nuts>	Sure we leak nude celebs and no one cares 
Jul 02 20:46:35 <snarkypants>	the world cared about that
Jul 02 20:46:37 <x316nuts>	No one cares about jailbait back in the day 
Jul 02 20:46:54 <snarkypants>	remember when they sub used to show up on google?
Jul 02 20:46:57 <SlyRatchet>	Regarding site funding: I'd recommend that the admins just introduce advertising. The amount of money they could rise from targets adds would rival YouTube on a per add basis
Jul 02 20:47:05 <SlyRatchet>	per view** basis
Jul 02 20:47:08 <x316nuts>	  no one cares about coon town, sex with dogs etc 
Jul 02 20:47:14 <x316nuts>	But we're drawing the line here 
Jul 02 20:47:16 <Ivashkin>	alienth, we don't have to see user info, even something like flagging alts to mods in threads would help
Jul 02 20:47:18 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: reddit has advertising
Jul 02 20:47:19 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, I could try to work my way in from the inside. Pose as a recently graduated CS student - but really, I'm a mod looking for revenge
Jul 02 20:47:20 <x316nuts>	K 
Jul 02 20:47:37 <picflute>	fuck
Jul 02 20:47:38 <Ivashkin>	just something we can see that says dude 3, 9 and 43 are using the same IP
Jul 02 20:47:39 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: that is one of the main revenue streams of reddit, in fact
Jul 02 20:47:45 <alienth>	advertising and gold
Jul 02 20:47:53 <Kreius>	adblocker and don't buy gold. got it
Jul 02 20:48:02 <Locutus>	SlyRatchet: Might be worth making the list of requests look a bit less like demands? Can't hurt to make things look less aggressive.
Jul 02 20:48:16 <Kreius>	when did alienth leave reddit? #newstome
Jul 02 20:48:21 <alienth>	Kreius: back in Feb
Jul 02 20:48:23 <Obliviater>	A while ago

Jul 02 20:48:37 <gonzobot>	(joyouscacophony) Sorry r/gadgets is set to private and I cannot access it.
Jul 02 20:48:38 <SlyRatchet>	alienth it has adds? I know it has space for adds but I've literally *never* seen a real add on there.
Jul 02 20:48:50 <x316nuts>	When they made all employees move to San Francisco BUT NO RIOTS FOR THAT 
Jul 02 20:48:53 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: sidebar ads and sponsored links at the top of listings, for many years
Jul 02 20:49:07 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: https://www.reddit.com/advertising
Jul 02 20:49:10 <teaearlgraycold>	alienth, ooh, stack overflow?
Jul 02 20:49:13 <x316nuts>	Make all of the employees uproot their lives? Don't give a fuck 
Jul 02 20:49:14 <teaearlgraycold>	My man
Jul 02 20:49:16 <joyouscacophony>	Gadgets went private
Jul 02 20:49:19 <SlyRatchet>	I've seen the sidebar adds, but there's never adds in them. Just little things which tell me thanks for not using adblock
Jul 02 20:49:26 <Kreius>	I'm waiting to see if MillenniumFalc0n makes NTO go private.
Jul 02 20:49:33 <SlyRatchet>	I know they have advertising *functionality* but that's not what they've been used for
Jul 02 20:49:40 <Relic2279>	x316nuts: ehh, I remember some people giving a fuck about that. there were some angry defaultmod/modtalk posts and threats of going dark
Jul 02 20:49:50 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: nah, there are ads there. you're probably blind to them, like myself.
Jul 02 20:49:59 <alienth>	there have been movie ads there quite recently
Jul 02 20:49:59 <SlyRatchet>	Locutus: I agree on making them look less like demands. It's just that I wrote this like five minutes ago in MC word :P
Jul 02 20:50:02 <alienth>	for some movie i don't remember
Jul 02 20:50:03 <alienth>	heh
Jul 02 20:50:09 <x316nuts>	"threats"  = please pay attention to me so I feel important 
Jul 02 20:50:11 <Locutus>	Ahah
Jul 02 20:50:14 <Locutus>	Makes sense
Jul 02 20:50:14 <x316nuts>	Please boost my ego 
Jul 02 20:50:20 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: we set a policy of never doing animated/fullpage ads when I was there.
Jul 02 20:50:29 <x316nuts>	Shut the fuck up they just want to look at goddamn memes 
Jul 02 20:50:37 <SlyRatchet>	Alienth you worked at reddit?
Jul 02 20:50:37 <GodOfAtheism>	imgoingtohellforthis joins le reddit mod revolution
Jul 02 20:50:37 <snarkypants>	remember the policy about remote employees being allowed
Jul 02 20:50:41 <snarkypants>	then they changed it
Jul 02 20:50:44 <x316nuts>	Reddit politics is nothing to them 
Jul 02 20:50:45 <Ivashkin>	my ads just say "thanks for not using adblock" which is odd because I am
Jul 02 20:50:45 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: for 4 years :)
Jul 02 20:50:48 <Relic2279>	x316nuts: I think if a few subreddits actually did it, then others would feel inclined to do the same, like dominos. IAMA and Askreddit were the first dominoes this time around
Jul 02 20:50:50 <teaearlgraycold>	There have been threats of "going dark" so many times before - but this time 1 subreddit needed to go dark because their entire workflow was fucked over. Others saw this as an opportunity to do what they'd always hoped to do. So for unrelated reasons they shut down
Jul 02 20:50:53 <snarkypants>	policies arent forever
Jul 02 20:51:21 <alienth>	snarkypants: i do! i was a remote employee :)
Jul 02 20:51:28 <kwiztas>	we in politics have a vote we might join everyone in 7 days when our procedures are done...

Jul 02 21:07:55 <xlnqeniuz>	none of them make it
Jul 02 21:07:59 <Cylon>	4 years i've been waiting for something like this to happen
Jul 02 21:08:18 <GuitarFreak>	hey alienth, do you know if the way reddit reports traffic stats on /r/sub/about/traffic changed at all in the last few years? (before you left anyway)
Jul 02 21:08:31 <GuitarFreak>	like, since 2012-2013?
Jul 02 21:08:31 <x316nuts>	Cylon woo 
Jul 02 21:08:46 <Cylon>	woooooo
Jul 02 21:08:50 <alienth>	GuitarFreak: uhh, there was a refactoring at some point in there. not sure what impact it may have had.
Jul 02 21:09:03 <alienth>	GuitarFreak: you might find something in /r/changelog about it>?
Jul 02 21:09:08 <GuitarFreak>	I remember traffic reporting was fixed in 2012
Jul 02 21:09:11 <GuitarFreak>	before that it was really broken
Jul 02 21:09:20 <GuitarFreak>	but I didn't know if anything changed since then or not
Jul 02 21:09:36 <alienth>	there was cleanup, but to my knowledge no signfiicant changes since that refactor
Jul 02 21:09:41 <GuitarFreak>	huh, alright
Jul 02 21:09:43 <alienth>	it works via pixel checks
Jul 02 21:10:01 <alienth>	don't quote me on that, of course :) my memory isn't perfect.
Jul 02 21:10:09 <GuitarFreak>	I was just looking through some old traffic stats I had and noticed /r/funny gets like 100 million less pageviews than it did in 2012
Jul 02 21:10:21 <GuitarFreak>	wondering if something changed or the subreddit was really not as popular anymore
Jul 02 21:10:25 <alienth>	yes, that is true. i believe /r/funny did contract considerably.
Jul 02 21:10:46 <GuitarFreak>	pics is fairly simiar, only down a little
Jul 02 21:10:56 <alienth>	things also changed up when we added more defaults
Jul 02 21:11:01 <x316nuts>	Well that was the plan Yeah? 
Jul 02 21:11:07 <GuitarFreak>	yeah, that was my guess
Jul 02 21:11:15 <GuitarFreak>	lots more defaults to spread the traffic out
Jul 02 21:11:16 <x316nuts>	More defaults = spread out traffic 
Jul 02 21:11:24 <rya|dinner>	it worked!
Jul 02 21:11:26 <x316nuts>	Woo +1 for me Yay 
Jul 02 21:11:49 <x316nuts>	More eggs in the basket is always good 
Jul 02 21:12:02 <GuitarFreak>	it actually gets a few million more uniques than 2012, but less overall pageviews
Jul 02 21:12:09 <SlyRatchet>	how many subscribers does IAMA have?
Jul 02 21:12:13 <picflute>	8 mill?
Jul 02 21:12:28 <GuitarFreak>	yeah, somewhere over 8M
Jul 02 21:12:31 <picflute>	http://redditmetrics.com/r/IAmA
Jul 02 21:12:42 <alienth>	GuitarFreak: also consider mobile app traffic, which isn't factored in at all on subreddit traffic.
Jul 02 21:12:49 <GuitarFreak>	ooo
Jul 02 21:12:54 <noeatnosleep>	Oh, wow
Jul 02 21:12:54 <alienth>	and folks have definitely been transitioning more to mobile over the years
Jul 02 21:12:57 <GuitarFreak>	that's probably a big thing
Jul 02 21:12:58 <noeatnosleep>	I didn't know that. 
Jul 02 21:13:05 <alienth>	mobile *web* traffic is tracked
Jul 02 21:13:06 <GuitarFreak>	lots has changed in 3 years
Jul 02 21:13:09 <picflute>	Wait what
Jul 02 21:13:17 <picflute>	Mobile Traffic isn't counted?
Jul 02 21:13:18 <alienth>	mobile *app* traffic is not (in subreddit traffic counts)
Jul 02 21:13:20 <blueshiftlabs>	alienth: but not API traffic?
Jul 02 21:13:22 <alienth>	yea
Jul 02 21:13:23 <noeatnosleep>	I assumed app traffic was counted 
Jul 02 21:13:30 <noeatnosleep>	That's nuts. 
Jul 02 21:13:31 <alienth>	app traffic is damn tricky
Jul 02 21:13:32 <blueshiftlabs>	that would explain a lot
Jul 02 21:13:40 <blueshiftlabs>	sounds like kind of a failing
Jul 02 21:13:41 <alienth>	because a lot of it is difficult to differentiate from automated stuff
Jul 02 21:13:48 *	noeatnosleep is questioning his world
Jul 02 21:13:54 <alienth>	and also there are some many different apps which have different pattersn
Jul 02 21:13:56 <blueshiftlabs>	By user-agent?
Jul 02 21:14:05 <alienth>	and a 'pageview' doesn't really translate appropriately for some apps
Jul 02 21:14:14 <alienth>	like, one app can make 5 api calls and show one screen
Jul 02 21:14:20 <alienth>	while another makes a single API call for the same thing
Jul 02 21:14:22 <alienth>	it is a nightmare.
Jul 02 21:14:24 <noeatnosleep>	Dang. I had no idea. 
Jul 02 21:14:31 <blueshiftlabs>	ugh, I can imagine
Jul 02 21:15:15 <sarahbotts>	huh, TIL
Jul 02 21:15:21 <blueshiftlabs>	alienth: how does RES affect traffic stats?
Jul 02 21:15:43 <alienth>	blueshiftlabs: it does to some degree, due to never-ending reddit. i don't recall the exact impact.
Jul 02 21:15:46 <blueshiftlabs>	I would imagine it decreases it somewhat, because you don't have a page hit per listing
Jul 02 21:15:57 <alienth>	i think RES actually started hitting the pixels at some point, tho
Jul 02 21:16:05 <alienth>	it's a bit up in the air
Jul 02 21:16:20 <alienth>	also the majority of visitors don't use RES
Jul 02 21:16:24 <PM>	seriously now /r/videos is private, those mods can go fuck themselfs
Jul 02 21:16:25 <alienth>	so wasn't a major impact
Jul 02 21:16:47 <Obliviater>	Hey no

Jul 02 21:17:07 <xlnqeniuz>	fight fght fight
Jul 02 21:17:27 <picflute>	Kappa
Jul 02 21:17:30 <PM>	can't use reddit because a hand full of mods are acting like children. 
Jul 02 21:17:31 <picflute>	But seriously
Jul 02 21:17:33 <picflute>	your ezreal
Jul 02 21:17:41 <Obliviater>	I voted against it

Jul 02 21:17:44 <gonzobot>	(alienth) There is no need to be upset - length 12m 17s - 28,105 likes, 414 dislikes (98.5%) - 1,751,738 views - Simen Martinussen on 2012.08.11
Jul 02 21:17:49 <Obliviater>	But I was over ruled
Jul 02 21:17:51 <GuitarFreak>	thanks for the insight alienth :D I'm always interested in reddit traffic stuff
Jul 02 21:18:11 <alienth>	whenever major drama flareups happened at reddit, i'd usually play that on my TV upstairs a few times.
Jul 02 21:18:20 <alienth>	when i still worked there
Jul 02 21:18:29 <GuitarFreak>	hahaha
Jul 02 21:19:06 <Xylan_Treesong>	Wait, so the shut downs aren't unanimous among the mods?
Jul 02 21:19:11 <Xylan_Treesong>	I assumed they were
Jul 02 21:19:23 <alienth>	Xylan_Treesong: when is anything ever unanimous among mods :/ ?
Jul 02 21:19:33 <Obliviater>	Voats down
Jul 02 21:19:47 <Xylan_Treesong>	Most major changes in /r/NFL are unanimous
Jul 02 21:19:48 <xlnqeniuz>	Ofcourse it is
Jul 02 21:20:02 <alienth>	Xylan_Treesong: nice, that's good to hear :)
Jul 02 21:20:07 <blueshiftlabs>	Obliviater: when is Voat *not* down?
Jul 02 21:20:14 <Obliviater>	Lol
Jul 02 21:20:45 <alienth>	Xylan_Treesong: it's unfortunate that football is the scourge of society.
Jul 02 21:20:52 <alienth>	down with football, btw
Jul 02 21:20:54 <alienth>	*cough*
Jul 02 21:21:04 <Cylon>	i need to be able to split screen this with my video games
Jul 02 21:21:19 <Cylon>	this is too good
Jul 02 21:21:20 <picflute>	I'll never get why Voat used C# ASP
Jul 02 21:21:22 <blueshiftlabs>	what's going to be left on the defaults?
Jul 02 21:21:25 <blueshiftlabs>	/r/aww?
Jul 02 21:21:27 <Obliviater>	@sarahbotts
Jul 02 21:21:34 <Obliviater>	Xaviormendal took modtalk
Jul 02 21:21:36 <Obliviater>	on voat
Jul 02 21:21:39 <Obliviater>	how ironic
Jul 02 21:21:41 <picflute>	KAPPA
Jul 02 21:21:42 <Xylan_Treesong>	Football has 4 downs
Jul 02 21:21:59 <picflute>	https://www.reddit.com/subreddits

Jul 02 21:22:16 <sarahbotts>	oh damn
Jul 02 21:22:19 <sarahbotts>	wait is this modtalk
Jul 02 21:22:21 <XenoBen>	ASP C# sits nicely on azure
Jul 02 21:22:29 <sarahbotts>	oops don't mind that
Jul 02 21:22:35 <blueshiftlabs>	sarahbotts: yes, this is modtalk
Jul 02 21:22:35 <picflute>	Hey /r/LoL is top 10 now
Jul 02 21:22:47 <xlnqeniuz>	LOL
Jul 02 21:22:55 <Obliviater>	>.<
Jul 02 21:22:58 <Obliviater>	this is shit it really is
Jul 02 21:23:03 <picflute>	LOL
Jul 02 21:23:04 <sarahbotts>	thought it was defaultmods for a sec
Jul 02 21:23:06 <Xylan_Treesong>	blueshiftlabs: Wait, Canada is real? I always assumed that was a myth.
Jul 02 21:23:07 <tizorres>	how do u look at top subs?
Jul 02 21:23:12 <picflute>	https://www.reddit.com/subreddits
Jul 02 21:23:15 <alienth>	picflute: how is the game doing, btw? still growing?
Jul 02 21:23:20 <Xylan_Treesong>	Kidding. They're our friendly southern neighbours
Jul 02 21:23:26 <sarahbotts>	alienth it's bigger than ever right now
Jul 02 21:23:31 <alienth>	mm
Jul 02 21:23:41 <alienth>	i don't hate it, but i cannot bring myself to enjoy it.
Jul 02 21:23:45 <sarahbotts>	Iunno, I like it. I play a stupid amount of league though
Jul 02 21:23:45 <alienth>	so i'm an outsider to that culture
Jul 02 21:23:49 <SlyRatchet>	Guys, what do you think to the preamble?  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmZVV7i0aWfDnzyrFlPVBRpl5SUojlhUvb5COElZIYU/edit
Jul 02 21:23:58 <alienth>	starcraft is my game
Jul 02 21:24:27 <picflute>	We're currently in the recovering phase in r/lol. They just cooled off after hating Riot for not having a new client. 
Jul 02 21:24:31 <sarahbotts>	it's honestly a sunk cost though
Jul 02 21:24:35 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: replace with "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another"
Jul 02 21:24:52 <sarahbotts>	There is a calculator for how much life you've spent playing league... and when you see the numbers it's not pretty
Jul 02 21:25:09 <alienth>	sarahbotts: playing or having the client open?
Jul 02 21:25:18 <sarahbotts>	playing
Jul 02 21:25:27 <alienth>	i have like 60 days play time on WoW, from the first couple years alone. haven't touched it in some time.
Jul 02 21:25:29 <sarahbotts>	it's calculated based on games (wins/losses)
Jul 02 21:25:42 <sarahbotts>	I think the game length is available through their api
Jul 02 21:25:47 <alienth>	neat
Jul 02 21:25:48 <x_plus_popcorn>	lol /r/4chan went private
Jul 02 21:25:49 <Locutus>	SlyRatchet: Make sure you've capitalised the "V" in "Victoria".
Jul 02 21:25:53 <xlnqeniuz>	rofl
Jul 02 21:25:53 <Cylon>	SlyRatchet, first sentence has redundancies
Jul 02 21:25:56 <sarahbotts>	either way you can estimate about 30-35 min per win or loss
Jul 02 21:26:05 <XenoBen>	i want cj back
Jul 02 21:26:07 <XenoBen>	i miss it
Jul 02 21:26:22 <alienth>	XenoBen: braveryjerk is still up
Jul 02 21:26:22 <sarahbotts>	It has such a high learning curve, I was playing dota for a bit and it's just not worth putting in the time o learn another moba
Jul 02 21:26:22 <Cylon>	"the reason for the blackout was caused by" should either be the reason for the blackout was or the blackout was caused by
Jul 02 21:26:25 <sarahbotts>	though I do play hots
Jul 02 21:26:31 <SlyRatchet>	Alienth sounds like a Marx quote or something
Jul 02 21:26:56 <SlyRatchet>	Cylon editting, Locutus thanks! I won't let me dyslexia get in the way!
Jul 02 21:27:05 <Ivashkin>	what is DOTA?
Jul 02 21:27:09 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: uhh.. that's the preamble of the Declaration of Independence...
Jul 02 21:27:17 <XenoBen>	braveryjerk isnt the same though...
Jul 02 21:27:17 <Cylon>	ahaahahahaha
Jul 02 21:27:19 <XenoBen>	its not cj
Jul 02 21:27:21 <sarahbotts>	err techinically it's dota2
Jul 02 21:27:32 <Ivashkin>	i keep hearing about it, have absolutely no idea what it's about
Jul 02 21:27:33 <alienth>	SlyRatchet accusing Thomas Jefferson of being Marxist!
Jul 02 21:27:34 <Locutus>	Ivashkin: Overgrown Warcraft 3 game mod with aspirations above its station. Pretty huge player base.
Jul 02 21:27:34 <SlyRatchet>	Marx... Founding Fathers.... Same thing, right?
Jul 02 21:27:37 <sarahbotts>	defense of the ancients 2, it's a moba
Jul 02 21:27:51 <sarahbotts>	the irony is that league is based off of dota 2 :P
Jul 02 21:28:01 <Ivashkin>	so not a co-op zombie shooter?
Jul 02 21:28:06 <sarahbotts>	baron nashor, roshan amirite
Jul 02 21:28:07 <SlyRatchet>	In my defence, I am British! It's half past two in the morning as well!
Jul 02 21:28:10 <blueshiftlabs>	sarahbotts: or rather, dota 2 and league were both based off dota 1
Jul 02 21:28:24 <XenoBen>	so hows bernie doing
Jul 02 21:28:34 <sarahbotts>	lol details
Jul 02 21:28:39 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: ah, the redcoats!

Jul 02 21:29:32 <allthefoxes>	sarahbotts, dota 1 happened, but in the time between 1 and 2, the gap was taken advantage of and they made lol
Jul 02 21:29:38 <x_plus_popcorn>	yds was the second big sub I got modded to
Jul 02 21:29:52 <SlyRatchet>	I'm gonna put a note in the bottom, in size 6 font, which says "also, supports the annexation of the USA into the United Kingdom as an overseas territory" and all the mods will have signed off their agreement ^_^
Jul 02 21:29:57 <alienth>	to take a brief and crude step back from today's mess, I do think it is amusing that y'all are working on this type of document 2 days  before July 4th.
Jul 02 21:30:16 <multi-mod>	why does the #darkening sound more racist than revolutionary? :P
Jul 02 21:30:17 <Cylon>	oh wow
Jul 02 21:30:17 <XenoBen>	SlyRatchet: im all for pushing wales to the USA
Jul 02 21:30:19 <alienth>	maybe this is all just an avant garde reenactment?
Jul 02 21:30:20 <blueshiftlabs>	ooh
Jul 02 21:30:26 <Cylon>	alienth good catch
Jul 02 21:30:29 <blueshiftlabs>	can we hold off on releasing it until Saturday?
Jul 02 21:30:46 <Cylon>	i now choose to believe that we're all simply trapped in a computer simulation and this is all a joke
Jul 02 21:30:58 <JustPassingThrough>	#AMAgeddon is better, props to that one dude in srd and the one dude who stole it from srd who i stole it from
Jul 02 21:30:59 <SlyRatchet>	I'd actually completely forgotten Independence Day was upcoming. Now I feel the need to put in some more cool references... Would that spoil the mood?
Jul 02 21:31:05 <XenoBen>	we are in skynets simulation
Jul 02 21:31:14 <blueshiftlabs>	In Reddit, July 4, 2015
Jul 02 21:31:19 <SlyRatchet>	Paging fellow mdoerator TheSkyNet
Jul 02 21:31:44 <XenoBen>	he aint here
Jul 02 21:31:56 <blueshiftlabs>	The unanimous Declaration of the United Moderators of Reddit
Jul 02 21:31:58 <alienth>	SlyRatchet: yep, today is the last workday for most, too. 3 day weekend (July 3rd is a federal holiday this yr since the 4th is a Sat)
Jul 02 21:32:18 <xlnqeniuz>	Aaand books is down
Jul 02 21:32:23 <allthefoxes>	rip
Jul 02 21:32:23 <Locutus>	ouch.
Jul 02 21:32:26 <alienth>	no taxation, err, moderation without representation?
Jul 02 21:32:30 <allthefoxes>	LOL
Jul 02 21:32:34 <allthefoxes>	new slogan pls
Jul 02 21:32:40 <multi-mod>	books has been burned, the censors have won!
Jul 02 21:32:44 <Ivashkin>	fuck it, i'm tempted to take /ukpolitics down
Jul 02 21:33:05 <SlyRatchet>	That should so be the name of our moderators' union
Jul 02 21:33:07 <allthefoxes>	me irl: http://imgur.com/cUyEqy4
Jul 02 21:33:13 <XenoBen>	Ivashkin: do it
Jul 02 21:33:20 <XenoBen>	most of the users on it are horrible anyway
Jul 02 21:33:23 <Locutus>	ooft
Jul 02 21:33:29 <Ivashkin>	yeah
Jul 02 21:33:32 <Locutus>	Sure it'd be a good idea? 
Jul 02 21:33:40 <Locutus>	I mean, it'd just shunt traffic to /r/uk
Jul 02 21:33:58 <XenoBen>	send them to /r/murica
Jul 02 21:34:06 <Ivashkin>	I think most of our users would be suprised to find other subs exist
Jul 02 21:34:08 <XenoBen>	get this party started early
Jul 02 21:34:18 <Locutus>	fair observation.
Jul 02 21:34:23 <xlnqeniuz>	books is back up
Jul 02 21:34:24 <xlnqeniuz>	LOL
Jul 02 21:34:25 <xlnqeniuz>	wtf
Jul 02 21:34:25 <multi-mod>	in other news the admins have found a wya to promote non-default subreddits!
Jul 02 21:34:36 <allthefoxes>	IN OTHER NEWS
Jul 02 21:34:40 <allthefoxes>	!karma allthefoxes
Jul 02 21:34:40 <redditBot>	allthefoxes has 48,024 link karma and 100,370 comment karma.
Jul 02 21:34:42 <allthefoxes>	I DID IT
Jul 02 21:34:45 <Flashynuff>	rofl multi-mod 
Jul 02 21:34:46 <XenoBen>	karma whoreeeeee
Jul 02 21:34:46 <multi-mod>	welp, that was quick books
Jul 02 21:34:58 <alienth>	to be non-silly for a moment: I'm kinda on the outside from all of the happenings. All I can do is encourage folks to think about what blackouts are working to accomplish. One thing I'm sure y'all are aware of is that the non-mod community is a party in this whole plot as well. The pendulum can easily shift when a mob is formed :/
Jul 02 21:34:58 <xlnqeniuz>	They sure show'd em
Jul 02 21:35:06 <alienth>	so, be careful, and think on things carefully i guess.
Jul 02 21:35:17 <Locutus>	Ivashkin: Probably a bad idea, though. I mean, ukpolitics mobs can be unpleasant.
Jul 02 21:35:18 <alienth>	wish i could be of more help :(
Jul 02 21:35:20 <Flashynuff>	Honestly
Jul 02 21:35:22 <Locutus>	You might end up the target. =\
Jul 02 21:35:22 <sarahbotts>	yeah...mobs are scary
Jul 02 21:35:25 <allthefoxes>	alienth, yeah, thats true..but..i mean, what else do we do? Keep whining? Thats gotten us..mm..no where in the last how many years?
Jul 02 21:35:27 <Flashynuff>	I just want things to change in some way
Jul 02 21:35:34 <sarahbotts>	especially when they're against you
Jul 02 21:35:35 <SlyRatchet>	Yeah. What's really annoying me is that there is no way to communicate what is happening to the general public
Jul 02 21:35:41 <sarahbotts>	we learned that the hard way in league
Jul 02 21:35:55 <allthefoxes>	I mean, our options are: A. Deal with it
Jul 02 21:35:55 <Ivashkin>	another mod complaint, we can't block twats from modmail
Jul 02 21:35:57 <allthefoxes>	B. Keep whining
Jul 02 21:36:00 <allthefoxes>	C. Do something
Jul 02 21:36:05 <XenoBen>	yes modmail block
Jul 02 21:36:06 <multi-mod>	damnit books, I couldn't even finish sining the refrain "we shall overco..." before you went public again
Jul 02 21:36:08 <XenoBen>	stop spammers
Jul 02 21:36:09 <allthefoxes>	And for C. the options are pretty limited
Jul 02 21:36:10 <sarahbotts>	modmail block please
Jul 02 21:36:15 <Locutus>	Dear god, modmail block
Jul 02 21:36:19 <sarahbotts>	also something like if a person is spamming a message fucking don't let them do that
Jul 02 21:36:26 <allthefoxes>	We can't just do a mass sticky post
Jul 02 21:36:27 <SlyRatchet>	Good idea! putting that into the declaration of independence
Jul 02 21:36:31 <XenoBen>	I DEMAND MODMAIL BLOCKS, OR NEARLYTRUESTORY WILL GO PRIVATE
Jul 02 21:36:31 <allthefoxes>	look how well reddit 101 went
Jul 02 21:36:37 <x_plus_popcorn>	books is back
Jul 02 21:36:39 <x_plus_popcorn>	:(
Jul 02 21:36:40 <allthefoxes>	(Hint, it went terrible)
Jul 02 21:36:52 <Ivashkin>	I banned a user, they PM'd me ever 5 mins for 18 hours
Jul 02 21:36:54 <Locutus>	We're still getting modmails from one of /u/bulldog312's blizzard of alts, months later. It's more funny than anything else, but it doesn't half get tiresome with some users.
Jul 02 21:36:54 <SlyRatchet>	I thought reddit 101 was supposed to have gone well outside of /r/europe?
Jul 02 21:36:59 <allthefoxes>	not really
Jul 02 21:37:00 <Ivashkin>	18 hours!
Jul 02 21:37:04 <Locutus>	...
Jul 02 21:37:05 <Locutus>	:|
Jul 02 21:37:06 <allthefoxes>	it got a 51% score on /r/pics
Jul 02 21:37:16 <SlyRatchet>	We got a user once who set up a script which mailed us the entire works of shakespeare
Jul 02 21:37:21 <SlyRatchet>	I was quite enjoying it TBF
Jul 02 21:37:26 <alienth>	allthefoxes: i hear ya, and i believe the reddit team is also aware that anything that is said is not worth much right now, because things have been being said for a long time. so, both sides of the argument are kinda at an impasse. i think the only thing that would appease the situation would be for action to be taken, but you won't see action on things like features without considerable lag time.
Jul 02 21:37:47 <allthefoxes>	Yeah, you are right
Jul 02 21:38:04 <blueshiftlabs>	https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3bxv9i/when_this_post_is_15_minutes_old_rbooks_will_go/
Jul 02 21:38:04 <gonzobot>	(blueshiftlabs) When this post is 15 minutes old, /r/books will go private for a day. : books - 9 comments, 26 points - DaedalusMinion, 3m ago
Jul 02 21:38:07 <alienth>	tiem will tell the outcome, i suppose :/
Jul 02 21:38:14 <sarahbotts>	Though Alexis's statements have been more detrimental than helpful imo
Jul 02 21:38:16 <Ivashkin>	but there is time for Reddit Dollars or whatever it was called?
Jul 02 21:38:25 <allthefoxes>	alienth, just personally, I'm really fed up. There is literally just..i mean, you know man
Jul 02 21:38:30 <allthefoxes>	how long this has been going on
Jul 02 21:38:30 <alienth>	Ivashkin: that project was shelved.
Jul 02 21:38:34 <blueshiftlabs>	Ivashkin: that guy got canned for a reason
Jul 02 21:38:37 <alienth>	Ivashkin: as was announced
Jul 02 21:38:44 <XenoBen>	snoogaming died pretty quick
Jul 02 21:38:46 <allthefoxes>	I could write a 30 volume works of all the reddit communication fuckup
Jul 02 21:38:48 <Ivashkin>	I missed that bit
Jul 02 21:39:01 <XenoBen>	redditmade died too
Jul 02 21:39:09 <Ivashkin>	but still, someone at one point thought "this is a good idea, lets spend time on it"
Jul 02 21:39:28 <Xylan_Treesong>	I'd add in, from what I've seen so far, non-mods don't seem to have a great idea of what is really wrong
Jul 02 21:39:38 <allthefoxes>	people need to keep linking OOTL
Jul 02 21:39:58 <x316nuts>	Muh karma 
Jul 02 21:40:07 <blueshiftlabs>	very few people understand all of what's going on, and most of them are in this channel
Jul 02 21:40:07 <Locutus>	Xylan_Treesong has a good point.
Jul 02 21:40:34 <allthefoxes>	you know what would be cool
Jul 02 21:40:43 <allthefoxes>	the remove button in modmail doing something
Jul 02 21:40:46 <allthefoxes>	also lol https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/40-ZKOEFysc.png
Jul 02 21:40:49 <SlyRatchet>	We should just do a version of reddit 101 across the site ASAP. It was hated then, but at least now it is transmitting useful information
Jul 02 21:42:37 <blueshiftlabs>	^ this, people need to understand WTF is going on
Jul 02 21:42:43 <Locutus>	We need something like SlyRatchet's points. But, they'd have to be succinct - and it'd best be phrased in a way that emphasises that we'd just like to be able to do our jobs better to make the subreddits we mod better experiences for everyone. I mean, obviously that'll get the SRC/KiA/ad nauseum lot whinging- but if it's a commonly held set of positions
Jul 02 21:42:43 <Locutus>	explained to users well enough, people would probably be fine with a day or so of disruption.

Jul 02 21:43:44 <SlyRatchet>	Yeah, I feel like my thing is too long
Jul 02 21:43:53 <Ivashkin>	i wonder how long before Reddit considers taking possession of the defaults
Jul 02 21:43:55 <XenoBen>	throw a meme in
Jul 02 21:44:07 <SlyRatchet>	I've written a pre-amble explaining why, but I don't feel as though ti really hits home (link again to save people scrolling up https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmZVV7i0aWfDnzyrFlPVBRpl5SUojlhUvb5COElZIYU/edit)
Jul 02 21:44:37 <SlyRatchet>	I think it'll be a couple of days before they seriously consider it, but I think it'll be desperate if they do. They know that those subreddits are useless without mods
Jul 02 21:44:49 <SlyRatchet>	It'd be like having a factory, but nobody who knows how to use it
Jul 02 21:45:06 <blueshiftlabs>	SlyRatchet: if they do, that will mostlikely kill reddit as we know it
Jul 02 21:45:42 <Cylon>	i think the mods will reopen the subs before the admins ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL
Jul 02 21:45:56 <SlyRatchet>	The threat of it would be enough
Jul 02 21:46:04 <Ivashkin>	not really
Jul 02 21:46:10 <Cylon>	but if they do, i really hope at least someone in the reddit office is yelling ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL the entire time

Jul 02 21:46:39 <allthefoxes>	This is what I say:

Jul 02 21:46:49 <allthefoxes>	dammit gonzobot 
Jul 02 21:47:15 <joyouscacophony>	spoilers!
Jul 02 21:47:44 <Ivashkin>	I also wonder at what point the admins will revolt against management
Jul 02 21:48:04 <Ivashkin>	there has to be a line where they are told to do something and will decide not to do it
Jul 02 21:48:17 <JustPassingThrough>	the line was 'move to SF'
Jul 02 21:48:56 <alienth>	Ivashkin: most of the time i was there the leadership folks felt like part of the team. definitely had disagreements, but in general we 'struggled together'
Jul 02 21:49:09 <x_plus_popcorn>	#racetogether
Jul 02 21:49:44 <Ivashkin>	I've been in situations where I was given ordered I really disagreed with, no idea what working in reddit is like though
Jul 02 21:49:49 <alienth>	also, i think most people would rather probably just leave rather than deal with the stress of fighting management. the stress isn't worth it.
Jul 02 21:49:50 <allthefoxes>	wow
Jul 02 21:50:00 <allthefoxes>	you know what I just thought of
Jul 02 21:50:08 <allthefoxes>	reddit is losing a shit ton of revenue right now
Jul 02 21:50:09 <x316nuts>	What 
Jul 02 21:50:11 <allthefoxes>	all that askreddit gold
Jul 02 21:50:14 <Locutus>	SlyRatchet: I'm not sure the ultimatum in the preamble is a good idea
Jul 02 21:50:21 <alienth>	Ivashkin: in this scenario it is a relatively tight-knit group of folks. i mean, there are like 60 people.
Jul 02 21:50:26 <x316nuts>	Or its saving money on bandwidth 
Jul 02 21:50:28 <Locutus>	We don't have much to bring to bear
Jul 02 21:50:32 <XenoBen>	plex got haxored
Jul 02 21:50:36 <allthefoxes>	wow stop being an optimist dude
Jul 02 21:50:38 <Flashynuff>	allthefoxes, that's alright. They still have their #2 and #3 subs, /r/funny and /r/etiquette
Jul 02 21:50:45 <Ivashkin>	dunbars number
Jul 02 21:50:53 <alienth>	allthefoxes: gold was still a rather small part of overall revenue.
Jul 02 21:51:03 <alienth>	i'm sure it will be missed if it dropped and stays low
Jul 02 21:51:06 <SlyRatchet>	Yeah I'm not 100 about it either locutus. I mean, it's kind of implied
Jul 02 21:51:09 <allthefoxes>	ads dont show on :this sub is private" pages ^ : )
Jul 02 21:51:13 <Locutus>	Perhaps phrasing it in terms of its being a protest to draw attention to the problem might be better, SlyRatchet? I mean, we risk being too confrontational.
Jul 02 21:51:18 <allthefoxes>	oh i messed my sarcastic smiley up
Jul 02 21:51:24 <TheMentalist>	SlyRatchet, is it you who is working on that Google Doc?
Jul 02 21:51:44 <alienth>	allthefoxes: yeah, i'm sure a bunch of ad campaigns are in a mess now, because subreddits can be targeted.

Jul 02 21:52:45 <Flashynuff>	music just went private
Jul 02 21:53:12 <allthefoxes>	wow SlyRatchet thats cringey, honestly
Jul 02 21:53:18 <SlyRatchet>	blueshiftlabs yeah that's how I'm trying to phrase it. But it's hard to phrase it as being a strike, without sounding confrontational. I think phrasing it as awareness is better
Jul 02 21:53:29 <alienth>	blueshiftlabs: if it was purely a strike, the community would probably demand that scabs be let in to take on the subreddits.
Jul 02 21:53:39 <allthefoxes>	SlyRatchet, this is pretty much all there is to it: https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods/comments/3bxt8q/whats_it_going_to_take_to_end_this_blackout/csqjaa0
Jul 02 21:53:46 <allthefoxes>	Dont need to make it any more than that
Jul 02 21:54:01 <blueshiftlabs>	allthefoxes: what's that say?
Jul 02 21:54:03 <TheMentalist>	SlyRatchet, can I suggest cutting this down dramatically?
Jul 02 21:54:04 <Locutus>	Let's not make it a strike thing
Jul 02 21:54:11 <Ivashkin>	allthefoxes, we're only geo-default mods :(
Jul 02 21:54:11 <TheMentalist>	As per allthefoxes' comment, yes
Jul 02 21:54:13 <allthefoxes>	yeah SlyRatchet thats way too long, and just reads badly
Jul 02 21:54:30 <SlyRatchet>	A) less dramatic B) shorter
Jul 02 21:54:45 <TheMentalist>	Also, PiratePad or something collaborative might be better, SlyRatchet :)
Jul 02 21:54:46 <INeedAnswers123>	music went private
Jul 02 21:55:04 <Locutus>	If we are to add a preamble/explanation thing, I think it might be phrased in terms of something like "We love this site, and want it to succeed- but we're struggling to do the job with the tools at hand". Bit cloying, but it's not altogether unfair
Jul 02 21:55:10 <SlyRatchet>	also, in my defence: I knew it was bad as  I wrote it. I figured I should write whatever way came first, and then improve on it. You can imagine whatever's in your head but it's useless until you put finger to keyboard
Jul 02 21:55:14 <allthefoxes>	All that needs to be said is basically: "A lot of subreddits are going private because they are tired of the lack of communication and semi disregard of the people who help run this site, all on thier free time, moderatrs"
Jul 02 21:55:19 <TheMentalist>	That's fair enough^
Jul 02 21:55:28 <Ivashkin>	one angle I would say is important to communicate to users is that bad mod tools and lack of admin help forces mods to moderate more aggressively than they would like to
Jul 02 21:55:34 <allthefoxes>	"Victoria leaving reddit was a simple "straw that broke the camels back""
Jul 02 21:55:35 <Gaget>	The admins give us the mushroom treatment. They keep us in the dark and feed us shit.
Jul 02 21:55:39 <allthefoxes>	kek
Jul 02 21:55:43 <Locutus>	allthefoxes: I think that's a one-step guaranteed way to turn the users against us.
Jul 02 21:56:04 <allthefoxes>	You know how you really turn them against us? Writing silly, long, documents and calling them declarations
Jul 02 21:56:11 <allthefoxes>	that makes us look like idiots with a power trip
Jul 02 21:56:14 <L_Cranston_Shadow>	Is it just me or did IAMA screw up by relying entirely on Victoria?
Jul 02 21:56:16 <Locutus>	It implies that we're somehow entitled to drag our communities along with us on this - it's not for our benefit, it's for theirs. 
Jul 02 21:56:19 <Locutus>	Yeah
Jul 02 21:56:31 <allthefoxes>	Ive been getting nothing but positive comments and support from my comments I left today
Jul 02 21:56:35 <XenoBen>	need some dank memes on frontpage
Jul 02 21:56:39 <L_Cranston_Shadow>	I can understand having an internal line to the admins when something goes wrong, but the other things they’re saying that she did, like scheduling and setup, could just as easily been done through the mods
Jul 02 21:56:41 <Locutus>	Not disagreeing- but I think making it positive is essential

Jul 02 21:56:48 <allthefoxes>	This is what I said:
Jul 02 21:56:49 <allthefoxes>	I want to make it a bit more clear that many moderators, Myself included, are saying this isn't t just about Victoria.
Jul 02 21:56:49 <allthefoxes>	I love Victoria. She was a great admin. But she's not with reddit and we have to deal with that. Nothing to be done
Jul 02 21:56:49 <allthefoxes>	What people are upset about is the clear lack of communication and the almost disregard of the thousands of people who help keep this site running, all with their free time.
Jul 02 21:56:50 <allthefoxes>	A lot of people are saying "well they are throwing a temper tantrum, shutting down the subreddits isn't the right call"
Jul 02 21:56:53 <allthefoxes>	Well, what would you do? Talk to them? We've been trying that for years.
Jul 02 21:57:15 <SlyRatchet>	btw guys, if you want to make sure I read something, put my name in it or leave it as a comment on the document. I cant write and keep up with how fast you guys are talking
Jul 02 21:57:26 <allthefoxes>	Trust me, dont make some declaration

Jul 02 21:59:24 <allthefoxes>	LOL
Jul 02 21:59:24 <L_Cranston_Shadow>	allthefoxes, many mods agree with you I think, but correct me if I’m wrong, not the three that really matter (/r/history, /r/science, and /r/iama), all of whom are really hurt by losing Victoria. Even if it isn’t about Victoria, it seems about the fact that there was no advance notice or fallback to catch their AMAs, which might as well be the same thing.

Jul 02 22:00:43 <allthefoxes>	alienth, no one knows for sure, but, it was very abrupt if she left
Jul 02 22:00:43 <SlyRatchet>	ok guys Key points A) the dismissal of Victoria is the STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK B) REddit's lack of communication and lack of tools makes our moderation bad. C) We love the site but we have to mod aggressively because our tools are bad D) we're doing this to make things better because the admins are ignoring the moderators and therefore ig

Jul 02 22:01:01 <L_Cranston_Shadow>	alienth, some people were saying that she was fired, but there’s a huge lack of proof anywhere. She left, everything beyond that is speculation and odds are it will remain that way

Jul 02 22:08:41 <stopscopiesme>	alienth: honestly it is a fucking pain in the ass for us to deal with this extra traffic and the hordes of people who don’t know our rules
Jul 02 22:08:43 <gilgamesh>	Modth of July
Jul 02 22:08:49 <MillenniumFalc0n>	eh, may may june drama from last year spilled into july right?
Jul 02 22:08:56 <stopscopiesme>	I think so
Jul 02 22:09:00 <spiders>	XenoBen, they're fantastic hunters
Jul 02 22:09:00 <TenthTARDIS>	Okay

Jul 02 22:09:09 <TenthTARDIS>	I've been away from everything today
Jul 02 22:09:10 <spiders>	they even catch other spiders
Jul 02 22:09:17 <TenthTARDIS>	And I come back
Jul 02 22:09:18 <XenoBen>	long legs, really small bodies
Jul 02 22:09:19 <spiders>	they've been known to prey on brown recluses
Jul 02 22:09:25 <TenthTARDIS>	And LNM is talking about going dark
Jul 02 22:09:26 <alienth>	stopscopiesme: mm... sounds like a reason to go private!

Jul 02 22:09:34 <TenthTARDIS>	And Victoria was fired

Jul 02 22:09:49 <stopscopiesme>	hahahaha, I wonder what other poor subreddit would get flooded if we went private. r/outoftheloop?
Jul 02 22:09:51 <MillenniumFalc0n>	but then there would be an expose on subredditcancer about how we're int he admin's pockets
Jul 02 22:09:52 <alienth>	stopscopiesme: i've always appreciated SRD's general ability to see drama for what it is (in most cases)
Jul 02 22:09:57 <MillenniumFalc0n>	and who wants to give them more ammunition
Jul 02 22:09:59 <spiders>	well yeah that's what they do
Jul 02 22:10:01 <spiders>	they sit

Jul 02 22:14:23 <kwiztas>	blueshiftlabs, wouldn't the stabee have to also buy the device?
Jul 02 22:14:24 <SlyRatchet>	You can sign your username at the bottom when it's done, then it will have precisely one spider

Jul 02 22:17:02 <SlyRatchet>	A) I think it needs a preamble because we need to explain to people what we're doing and why. B) I think we need a list of recommendations which can actually be fulfilled because otherwise there's no unified vision. Sure, they have *general* ideas, but nothing concrete

Jul 02 22:23:35 <Locutus>	^^^^^^^^
Jul 02 22:23:45 <x316nuts>	But all the kids want a riot 
Jul 02 22:23:48 <XenoBen>	How long until admin blog post
Jul 02 22:23:51 <multi-mod>	alienth, I think we just want to squeeze the admins for a bit of jolly good rabble rousing for a bit
Jul 02 22:23:52 <x316nuts>	And attention
Jul 02 22:23:53 <Ivashkin>	all default mods replaced with people in a contact center in Utah?
Jul 02 22:23:53 <SlyRatchet>	Change is a process. It has no end point. We can hope to nudge it in the right direction
Jul 02 22:23:55 <x316nuts>	Wat do 
Jul 02 22:24:11 <erikster>	there's literally nothing the admins could do right now to "fix" this
Jul 02 22:24:19 <XenoBen>	ban the mods
Jul 02 22:24:20 <erikster>	best move is to shut up for a week

Jul 02 22:24:43 <spiders>	erikster, they could do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvbCgnCJoA

Jul 02 22:25:04 <erikster>	werner__herzog, seriously, not a smart move on his part
Jul 02 22:25:17 <Locutus>	erikster: They could make a blog post stating that they intend to work on it, and request that mods work with them in a serious dialogue about how they can improve the site - I mean, literally any action would satisfy most
Jul 02 22:25:20 <werner__herzog>	but a hilarious one
Jul 02 22:25:31 <erikster>	truth
Jul 02 22:25:32 <x316nuts>	If everyone would take a deep breath, remember that no one at all cares about you or your ego and opinion, and remember that we're all here to serve the community even at times of petulant uprising 
Jul 02 22:25:36 <x316nuts>	That would be nice 
Jul 02 22:25:45 <geraldo>	it's probably best to let it go on for a bit until everyone calms down
Jul 02 22:25:51 <x316nuts>	Because shut up 
Jul 02 22:25:58 <erikster>	fourth of july will distract everyone
Jul 02 22:26:03 <multi-mod>	x316nuts, thankfully my tortured students have to care about my opinion of them
Jul 02 22:26:06 <geraldo>	if i were them i wouldn't make a post at least until tomorrow
Jul 02 22:26:07 <erikster>	fireworks to get their minds off things
Jul 02 22:26:25 <x316nuts>	No one even reads the fucking sidebar 
Jul 02 22:26:32 <XenoBen>	bah its 3:30am
Jul 02 22:26:40 <blueshiftlabs>	x316nuts: no one ever has, no one ever will
Jul 02 22:26:42 <Locutus>	XenoBen: casual.
Jul 02 22:26:48 <XenoBen>	fuk u
Jul 02 22:26:51 <x316nuts>	And here we are knuckle deep in our own assholes feeling important 
Jul 02 22:26:52 <XenoBen>	1v1
Jul 02 22:26:53 <XenoBen>	rust
Jul 02 22:26:57 <x316nuts>	Get over yourself 
Jul 02 22:27:15 <x316nuts>	No one cares about your leadership 
Jul 02 22:27:16 <Ivashkin>	I had "mime artists are strictly forbidden" in the sidebar rules, took months before someone asked why it was there
Jul 02 22:27:50 <Locutus>	x316nuts: I don't think many people are *that* up themselves, in fairness - I don't expect this fuss will last more than a day or so.
Jul 02 22:27:58 <x316nuts>	No one cares about your css or contests or rules. They just showed up along the way and here we are 
Jul 02 22:27:58 <SlyRatchet>	hehe. At this point the rules are more like manifestos which people use to hold moderator's to account, rather than things they actually read
Jul 02 22:28:12 <Ivashkin>	x316nuts, you are right. 
Jul 02 22:28:20 <x316nuts>	We. 
Jul 02 22:28:35 <JustPassingThrough>	x316nuts so i take it your cat sub will stay up
Jul 02 22:28:59 <multi-mod>	such anger, many expletives, wow
Jul 02 22:29:01 <x316nuts>	We rub ourselves raw telling each other how important we are but NO ONE CARES 
Jul 02 22:29:25 <sarahbotts>	>We rub ourselves raw
Jul 02 22:29:30 <sarahbotts>	I mean what you do in private...
Jul 02 22:29:32 <x316nuts>	Jpt I'll shoe horn my cats in somewhere 
Jul 02 22:30:17 <tizorres>	we use live for stuff now
Jul 02 22:30:18 <XenoBen>	fucking /r/fallout has gone dark
Jul 02 22:30:19 <tizorres>	heh
Jul 02 22:30:20 <tizorres>	https://www.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb
Jul 02 22:30:54 <allthefoxes>	holy fucking siht
Jul 02 22:30:54 <allthefoxes>	fuck
Jul 02 22:30:55 <allthefoxes>	admins
Jul 02 22:31:00 <SlyRatchet>	x316nuts where are you getting this idea that we're all up ourselves? People have just been discussing what they would like to happen, and being surprised by how much people have done
Jul 02 22:31:04 <allthefoxes>	please let us block people from modmail
Jul 02 22:31:08 <x316nuts>	All the mods get to categorically ignore users and we call ourselves heroes for ignoring idiots 
Jul 02 22:31:26 <x316nuts>	Admins ignore us and OH SHIT REVOLT 
Jul 02 22:31:54 <Locutus>	x316nuts: True. But on the flipside, we're the ones that have to deal with mountains of reddit's work for them - asking for better mod tools in *some* way isn't a bad thing. Not sure piggybacking off the blackouts are necessarily the best way of doing that, but it's really needed- we're all volunteers, and it's not much to ask for a little bit more
Jul 02 22:31:54 <Locutus>	communication on the state of the things we need to do our jobs.
Jul 02 22:31:54 <allthefoxes>	it just goes on and on and on https://www.allthefoxes.me/img/31-kGsmNko2.png
Jul 02 22:32:14 <Locutus>	totally don't think this should go on for more than a single day, though
Jul 02 22:32:17 <allthefoxes>	x316nuts, youre taking a very nihilistic approach here
Jul 02 22:32:20 <XenoBen>	even netsec is even off
Jul 02 22:32:22 <XenoBen>	god dammit
Jul 02 22:32:23 <Locutus>	that'd just be screwing everyone.
Jul 02 22:32:29 <x316nuts>	Duh 
Jul 02 22:32:32 <ManWithoutModem>	x316nuts, you act like these are one off things
Jul 02 22:32:42 <x316nuts>	I'm drunk and mouthy

Jul 02 22:32:50 <spiders>	x316nuts, what are you drinking?
Jul 02 22:32:55 <gilgamesh>	He's doj g the same thing with us
Jul 02 22:33:03 <SolarAquarion>	Locutus: reddit doesn't know the scale needed to treat mods as people
Jul 02 22:33:06 <allthefoxes>	woo
Jul 02 22:33:10 <SolarAquarion>	WE NEED TO UNIONIZE
Jul 02 22:33:12 <x316nuts>	Finished a 19% beer 
Jul 02 22:33:19 <spiders>	was it an IPA
Jul 02 22:33:24 <blueshiftlabs>	allthefoxes: what do you use for that image uploader?
Jul 02 22:33:30 <teaearlgraycold>	SolarAquarion, YES
Jul 02 22:33:31 <x316nuts>	And Fuck ya'll. I mean that in a nice way but Jesus 
Jul 02 22:33:35 <x316nuts>	No one cares 
Jul 02 22:33:35 <teaearlgraycold>	DEFAULT MOD UNION
Jul 02 22:33:43 <x316nuts>	No it was a barrel aged stout 
Jul 02 22:33:49 <spiders>	D:
Jul 02 22:33:51 <spiders>	jealous
Jul 02 22:33:52 <blueshiftlabs>	what's it called?
Jul 02 22:33:56 <SolarAquarion>	teaearlgraycold: International Mods of the World
Jul 02 22:34:05 <x316nuts>	My beer? Chocolate rain 
Jul 02 22:34:08 <Ivashkin>	you know, I'm really not sure how fucked I am about being a moderator anymore. The original reason I started to use reddit was because it was the only site my shitty call center job didn't block, now it's a job
Jul 02 22:34:10 <stopscopiesme>	my biggest gripe is that we are supposed to enforce reddit’s rules, and report stuff we can’t deal with to the admins, and then they don’t answer us
Jul 02 22:34:11 <allthefoxes>	blueshiftlabs, Screencloud
Jul 02 22:34:11 <spiders>	where do you get these ridiculous ABV stouts man
Jul 02 22:34:12 <Locutus>	werner__herzog: ffs
Jul 02 22:34:31 <x316nuts>	Admins want us to do our own shit 
Jul 02 22:34:42 <x316nuts>	And we do 
Jul 02 22:34:52 <Foamed>	I'd do your shit
Jul 02 22:34:57 <x316nuts>	Wink wink 
Jul 02 22:35:00 <Foamed>	;)
Jul 02 22:35:04 <blueshiftlabs>	allthefoxes: danke, been looking for useful shit to put on my server
Jul 02 22:35:06 <SolarAquarion>	GENERAL STRIKE
Jul 02 22:35:13 <XenoBen>	so when will subs reopen?
Jul 02 22:35:20 <blueshiftlabs>	NEVAR!!!!1!
Jul 02 22:35:21 <SlyRatchet>	Ivashkin if you feel as though moderating is interfering with your life, then your life comes first
Jul 02 22:35:41 <Locutus>	XenoBen: Probably within 12 hours, worst of worst cases. Past that, it starts getting a bit silly.
Jul 02 22:35:52 <Ivashkin>	it's not so much that it's interfering with my life, it's that it's interfering with my redditing
Jul 02 22:35:55 <XenoBen>	one my my subs i use for news has closed
Jul 02 22:35:57 <Foamed>	the worst thing that can happen is that people will realize that there's life outside reddit
Jul 02 22:36:01 <SolarAquarion>	NO WAR BUT CLASS WAR
Jul 02 22:36:03 <XenoBen>	and i need that news for work
Jul 02 22:36:13 <blueshiftlabs>	Foamed: what if /r/outside shuts down? what then?!?
Jul 02 22:36:18 <Foamed>	D:
Jul 02 22:36:24 <blueshiftlabs>	XenoBen: /r/netsec?
Jul 02 22:36:29 <XenoBen>	ye
Jul 02 22:36:37 <blueshiftlabs>	yeah, that's a bit of a blow

Jul 02 22:36:59 <SolarAquarion>	Hi ManWithoutModem
