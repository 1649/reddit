Basically, every pokemon player has a unique 5-digit number called OTN. Any pokemon they catch inherits this number. If you trade pokemon with other players, you will now have a copy of their OTN. There is an in-game lottery that generates a new 5-digit number, and checks it against your pokemons' OTNs for a ☒☒☒☒☒, ☐☒☒☒☒, ☐☐☒☒☒, or ☐☐☐☒☒ match. The purpose of this subreddit is to connect you with other OTNs so that you have more potential matches for the lottery, instead of waiting for a match on your OTN only.

Every day, the bot will post a new Dailythread. If a person posts their OTN in a root comment on this thread (using proper formatting), the bot will check that number against the database of all OTNs posted to the subreddit, and produce matches in the same 5-star format as above. The bot will give matches from least- to most-matching, and a hyperlink to the thread where that OTN was posted. Then, the commenter can contact the OP of that thread and arrange a pokemon trade.
