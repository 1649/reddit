SubDump
=============

This was almost entirely ripped from Novella.

This bot searches for comments that contain your keyword, and saves them. You can choose any or all of three modes

- Reddit Saving. PRAW doesn't allow you to save comments. No clue why. Bot will save the submission to its account

- MAILME. Bot will construct a list at the end of the cycle and send it to you. 

- SUBDUMP. Bot will post a permalink to the comment as 'Author in /r/Subreddit' in your sub
