SubSump
=============

This was almost entirely ripped from Novella.

This bot searches for comments that contain your keyword, and saves them for later reading. You can choose any or all of three modes

- Reddit Saving. PRAW doesn't allow you to save comments. No clue why. Bot will save the submission to its account

- MAILME. Bot will construct a list at the end of the cycle and send it to you. 

- SUBDUMP. Bot will post a permalink to the comment as 'Author in /r/Subreddit' in your sub
