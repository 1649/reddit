What a curiously specific bot. Written for /u/DuckVimes_

Searches for posts whose titles contain /u/. Generates usernames based on these words, and builds a comment containing some links about this username. Users can be registered as "Special users" and given a custom remark.

The bot will strip the username of any characters which do not belong in usernames. This means that the name can be touching punctuation and a lot of characters which normally would break a /u/ link.

[See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/27rniu/04_unewsletterly_u75000_uduckvimes_uautomoderator/) for a demonstration because I'm not sure how to describe this.
