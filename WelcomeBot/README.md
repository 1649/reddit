WelcomeBot
=============

Sends a PM to people who post in your subreddit for the first time. Can be configured to notice submissions, comments, or both.

If the PM fails to send, the name will still be saved to the database. It's better to drop out early and miss somebody than to end up on an infinite loop of sending spam.
