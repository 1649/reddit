        <strong>I want to configure my seedbox better. With automatic {folders, local backup}</strong>
        <p><p>HUGE thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm about 40 days into a seedbox through whatbox and it currently runs rTorrent/ruTorrent. But I could switch it to Deluge or Transmission.</p>
<p>I only had a 256GB SSD on my Windows-7 only laptop, but my seedbox filled up with moves/music, so I got a 4TB external HD.</p>
<p>I'd like to set up some sort of <strong>nightly backup script that would pull new files from the seedbox and put them on my local drive</strong>. I once installed linux and lived in CLI-only land for a month on my only computer so I could probably figure out rsync or something...but I still prefer GUI apps if possible.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like the seedbox to identify torrents by tracker and put them in folders {Music/what/, Videos/PtP} etc so I can easily move torrent content as my ratio needs change on each site. I'm currently using Remote Torrent Adder if that matters.</p></p>

        <p><p>If you prefer a gui, check out goodsync. You can find it on some trackers, and it's feature rich for syncing between Seedbox and local machine. </p></p>

        <p><p>So goodsync worked pretty well on the face of it. I was able to provide a reasonably complicated set of rules without much trouble. I'd probably recommend it to others. Except...</p>
<p><strong>FTP downloads are ungodly slow.</strong> Normally I get ~4MiB/sec using FileZilla. goodsync gets me just 247KiB/sec. Any idea what gives?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I guess SFTP:// (FTP over SSH) is super slow in goodsync (though it runs fine for filezilla). Switched it to FTPS:// (FTP with SSL) and speeds were normal.</p></p>
