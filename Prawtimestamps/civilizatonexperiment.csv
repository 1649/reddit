I'm planning on making a list of plugins which we'll use on the server. These will be tested this week/next week on a local server I run, and I will see how those work out. Also, I need suggestions for plugins, because I want everyone to give their own input on the plugins! Keep in mind that we'll be running on 1.7.10 as long as there won't be a replacement for Bukkit. As soon as there is a viable replacement for Bukkit, which runs on 1.8, we could think about moving to that. Please try to also remember when suggesting plugins, is that we're trying to stick to a vanilla minecraft experience, and we probably won't implement big game changers, like MCmmo and plugins like that.

* **Subreddit**
  * CSS/Theme
     * Only Gameisison is a moderator on the subreddit now, so it's up to him if he makes some people a moderator to do the CSS. If      he doesn't, we can always move to another subreddit.
   * Getting some rules in the sidebar, organizing the whole subreddit in general.
     * We need moderators for this.
* **Organization**
 * Organizing the jobs for everyone (Who does what?)

**Job list (AKA people who offered to help):**

* /u/GoldenAppleGuy is in charge of the CSS

* /u/mbach231 has offered to do run the server itself.

* /u/Yourself797 will be making the Worldpainter map if the community decides to go with a Worldpainter map.

So, from my understanding, it will be a set group of whitelisted people that will play at set times during the day.  The overall feel will be as close to vanilla as possible, but with some terrain modification of ores and the like to encourage conquest and trade.  Civilizations will not be set in stone, nor will punishments; all laws and rulings will instead be decided by player governments.  People will be preassigned to governments, but can leave later if they so desire, including being wandering nomads.

  Thank you all for your continued interest and input on this server, really glad that it's actually coming together (it's been *just* over two weeks since the initial idea was posted). We hope you're as excited for this as we are. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please post them or modmail us!

So it was pointed out that Citadel has a somewhat broken system in regards to how much protection is provided. As it stands, by default, Stone protects for 25 block-breaks, Iron protects for 250 block-breaks, and diamond protects for 1800 block-breaks. There's been some complaints that because of this, wars are far less likely to occur (due to everyone knowing that even if they manage to invade a city, everything worth taking will be protected).  
  
  Because of ApocBan, if a player is killed during PvP, they're banned for 10 minutes (less the killer is killed, in which case the original victim is then unbanned). This means if I kill someone inside their home, I have 10 minutes to get as many of their valuables as possible. If somebody has diamond reinforcing literally everything, it's nigh impossible to break open even a single chest (would need to be capable of breaking a block in 1/3rd of a second in order to break a SINGLE block in the 10-minute ban).  
  
  I propose we alter the amount of protection Stone, Iron and Diamond offer. While players should be able to have protection on their things, I can definitely see how Citadel would cause people to not want to invade cities, because everyone knows everything worth stealing is **very** well protected. I'm thinking something like Stone protects 32 block-breaks, Iron protects 128 block-breaks, and Diamond protects 512 block-breaks (just cause I like 2^N ). Each one offers 4x as much protection as the last (which means that it's still worth using Iron over Stone, though many players will likely prefer Iron over Diamond unless it comes down to protecting chests and the like). This'll also mean if a group of players is properly equipped for PvP and raiding, they could feasibly invade a city, kill players and have enough time to open a few chests before those killed respawn.  
  
  These aren't set-in-stone changes, I'd appreciate if others could provide input on what I'm proposing.  
  
  EDIT:  
  
Current settings for Citadel are as follows:  
  
* Stone = 16 block-breaks
* Iron = 64 block-breaks
* Diamond = 256 block-breaks",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,2122,10,Discussion,discussion
154057188,2jpzac,1413751224,1,0,ATreeOnMyGun,The Tech Tree,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2jpzac/the_tech_tree/,"Minecraft is a singleplayer game, balenced to be played with a single person. One place where this is most evident is in the game's Tech Tree.

Minecraft's Tech Tree consists of Wood-Stone-Iron-Diamond-Enchanted Diamond/Potions. For a single casual player, getting to Enchanted Diamond is a massive task, and most won't bother to go that far. For a dedicated or superplayer, Enchanted Diamond can be obtained in less than 10 hours of play, solo. A group of players can max it out even faster. It's not absurd to say that if a server has a successful launch with 20ish people online, diamond armor will be the norm within a week. Now, sparse ores and nerfed diamonds will negate this, but nontheless, players will still be able to quickly reach the end of the tech tree.

Now in the past, I've discussed how to bring players together. One way to do so is to design the tech tree in a way which fosters coopertive play. Civcraft uses a system called FactoryMod, which suffers from some flaws, but overall is an excellent idea. FactoryMod allows you to set up factories, which after a high intial fee, allow you to manufacture items cheaply in bulk. You might be able to create an iron factory for 100 iron, which allows you to produce 10 sets of iron armor at a time for 150 iron. To an individual, this lacks value, but is incredibly empowering to a group.

That being said, FactoryMod also changed how XP works. I'll go more into this in my next post (about bots and alternate accounts).

Now, FactoryMod is a good start to balencing the tech tree for multiplayer, but all it really does is add a higher cap. The ""base"" game is still absurdly easy to blow through. 

Bergecraft, a Civcraft spinoff that made radical changes, completley rebuilt the MC tech tree from the ground up.

Bergecraft made it immpossible to mine stone with a wood pick. You needed to use creeper's explosions or TNT to ""soften"" your first bit of stone (making it into minable cobblestone), then find exposed iron, and use an iron pick to mine smoothstone. Even still, iron picks would drain at ~16x speed when mining stone, so massive tunneling was not an option.

Needless to say, this greatly slowed me and the rest of my town on this server down (We spent inbetween 5-10 hours playing on it, but a lack of activity led us to stop). But it also forced us to work together like I never had in minecraft. We were all fully dedicated to pooling our extremely limited iron in order to hunt for more, caving and grabbing the scraps that we could. When we finally had enough to make a little cave and some stone buildings, it was an incredible acomplishment.

Bergecraft also added gold as a tier inbetween Iron and Diamond. This added another step on the tech tree, and was something of a nice touch.

Now, although I'd love to make it so only iron could break stone, I can understand why some people wouldn't enjoy this. Plus, if griefers managed to get thier hands on a large amount of smoothstone, they could wreck havock and make a grief that would be extremely hard to clean up.

But at the same time, I think that we should seriously look into options beyonf just FactoryMod, that will help extend the tech tree. Maybe below a certain level, it's to hot for you to stay down for long, and you'd be at a risk of randomly lighting on fire unless you wore a fireproof suit (gold armor?) that would be slowly damaged as time went on. 

Or maybe smelting every ingot would require 2 ore, making it more expensive and slowing people down.

This is a bit more open than my other threads, without a final conclusion on what I think would be best for the server. Feel free to add your own thoughts about the subject down in the comments, but I think it's pretty obvious a longer techtree would create a more rewarding expierence.

(Also, totally random note - maybe we should disable helments entirley. This is mean that nobody will need to equip one for protection, and instead will wear dyed leather ones for identification in a battle, like a uniform. Would be useful in more large-scale fights)",0,CivilizatonExperiment,,4067,9,Discussion,discussion

This is fantastic, because it starts to integrate a very important system - land control and unique resources. If we want organic and natural conflicts to grow, contributing to the expierment, we need to give people something to fight over and have conflict over. Land is an excellent answer, but they won't fight over it unless they're a valid reason to do so.

On Civcraft, war is a rare event, mostly do to personal dislike rather than actaully getting anything from it. There's an CRAZY amount of resources on the map, stacks and stacks of diamonds for everyone who bothers to mine it. With an active popoulation over 50 at almost all times over a year and a half (and often breaking over 100 at primetime!), we're still nowhere near getting through all the diamonds buried. Although it might make things easier, it's also remarkably boring. Nobody fights over land. Oh, he took that plains biome? Doesn't matter, we'll just grab this other one.

Why not make land extremely important? One, maybe two of each biome. Defintly just one snowy biome, since that's where the diamonds are. People will have conflicts over this land, and contend for power

At the same time, a small overall landmass will discourage the growth of seperate nations and cultures. But small biomes and limited land are needed for natural conflict.

So my proposal is this - the server is mostly a massive ocean, with scattered islands, no more than 10ish in total. Each island will contain 1-3 biomes, and all the islands will be atleast 2000 blocks apart from one another (A distance long enough that people will be discouraged from travelling, unless they have a proper reason. This will allow each Island to develop it's own culutre and have some degree of isolated conflict that won't affect the rest of the world.).

Much like Civcraft and hte ores system, each biome should have restrictions on what can grow. i.e, jungle trees only grow in a jungle, wheat only grows in plains, tree grow extra fast in forest. 

This valuable land with unique resources, both mineral and organic, will create extremely interesting situations, conflict, and trade.

Imagine raiders from a backwater island full of plains sailing to try and claim the Snowy Isles and thier diamonds, or the jungle people exporting the jungle logs that only grow there to the Mesa people, who can hardly grow wood at all. Imagine underground rail networks for island to island, shipping materials all over.

Also Ender Pearls,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2jmxdf/uniting_players_and_exponentialy_decreasing/,"In order to encourage players to unite, there needs to be benefits that reward uniting, rather than a lone-wolf playstyle.

Minecraft is designed and balenced as a singleplayer game. It is not designed to be stripped down for competitive PvP. As a result, gear grows exponentially more powerful. Diamond is far stronger than iron, Prot4 Diamond is VAAASTLY more powerful than Diamond, to the point where it cannot compete. 

This is fine in a singleplayer game, but doesn't work well for uniting players. Why? Well, let's assume you have enough riches to buy one set of Prot4, or 100 sets of Iron armor. Since Prot4 is vastly more powerful than even 100 sets of iron, you'll buy the Prot4, and become a one-man army.

But if we want to unite players together, it would make more sense for the 100 sets of iron to be more powerful. That way, people will pick that instead. But when you have 100 sets of iron,  you need 100 peopel to fill them, ecouraging players to work together to form militaristic forces rather than just go lone-wolf.

What I'm trying to say is that was need exponentually decreasing returns. As in the jump from leather to iron is massive, and the jump from iron to diamond is smaller than the leather-iron jump, and the jump from diamond to Prot4 is even smaller still. This will mean people are more inclided to make tons of iron and work together rather than just make prot for themselves. It gives a noticable advantage to those who work together.

So for this reason, I propose a large buff to leather gear, a medium one to iron, a small debuff to diamond, and a large debuff to enchants. 

Also, one other note about PvP. DISABLE ENDER PEARLS

Ender Pearls unbalence PvP by removing the home advantage. If players are fighting in a densley packed city, those who know all the alleyways and escape routes and traps should have the advantage. But this doesn't happen with ender pearls, because even a player who doesn't know the area can just pearl an absurb distance away, right over walls and right away from the combat. Or if two players are fighting on a moutainside, the knocking a player off the mountain should be a valid strategy, but isn't, since the other player can just get back onto the side with an ender pearl. Or you should be able to use water to slow down an enemy, but no, ender pearl. It destroys the spacing and terrain-based aspect of PvP, which in a game where you create the Terrain, should be a much larger part. 

TL:DR, buff lower armor levels, nerf higher ones, disable ender pearls.",5,CivilizatonExperiment,,2536,25,,

I'm expecting to have the test server go live sometime early this evening (hoping for around 5-6pm EST). I will edit in the IP info here and on the sidebar once it's live. If you have the free time and are willing to help, please jump on and try to break the world! The more errors we find now, the smoother the launch will go.  
  
EDIT:  
  
Alrighty, server should be open! Here's a current list of the plugins:  
  
* ApocBan - Allows for PvE and PvP deathbans, 1 minute and 10 minutes respectively.
* Citadel - Allows for block reinforcement/grief protection. Stone = 16 block-breaks, Iron = 64 block-breaks, Diamond = 256 block-breaks.
* NameLayer - Required by Citadel.
* CoreProtect - Server backups/rollback options.
* LocalChat - Can only hear players with certain range. 500m for now, does not limit /tell
* NoCheatPlus - Cheating/hacking prevention.
* ProtocolLib - Required by RandomCoords. 
* RandomSpawn - Spawn in a random area. **CURRENTLY DISABLED**
* RealisticBiomes - Changes growth rates of renewable resources per biome.
* RealWeather - Adds weather- and temperature-based effects to the game.
* WorldBorder - Limits the size of the world.
* WorldGuard - Denies players from using certain items.
* WorldEdit - Required by WorldGuard.
* WorldRatio - Changes the Nether:Overworld ratio from 1:8 to 1:1.  
  
If you encounter any issues whatsoever, please let me know and I'll do my best to find solutions for them! Also know that I haven't done any exploring in this world, so there's bound to be some lag due to world generation at first.

Considering how our map is only about 8km x 8km, this means the Nether is only going to be 1km x 1km. Doing some math, this means for me to travel across the **entire** server from corner to opposite corner is only a distance of about 1.4k, which seems like a rather small trip to make. I know we want to encourage players traveling to other cities and seeing different parts of the world, but I feel as though this trivializes travel.  
  
  There are a couple ways we can handle this. One is which is to disable the Nether. I'm currently planning on having Hell biomes exist in the Overworld so it's not as if this would eliminate all resources that exist in the Nether (quartz, blaze rods, etc). However, these areas probably won't be that big, and things like Netherrack and Quartz will probably be consumed quickly (this really isn't an issue, just something to consider). Another option would be to change the Overworld:Nether ratio via a plugin to be something closer to 1:1 instead of 8:1. Players would still be able to create portals and gather resources in the Nether, but it would not be ideal for fast traveling anymore.  
  
  
  Maybe people don't care about the Nether being small and, in fact, like it that way. Please let me know how people feel about the proposed solutions, or whether you'd be fine with not changing anything regarding the Nether. If you have a different solution, please feel free to contribute!",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,1642,7,,

So, there have been some problems with the End and it's dragon. I'll tell what has happened in the past day (From my POV).

**1.** LunisequiouS claims the end for The Technocracy of Omnitopia, he posts a picture about this.

**2**. Some people aren't happy with this, including me (Claiming a whole dimension is not so good for global world peace)

**3.** I decide to team up with a few people at Greyshore to open up the End, we travel to the big mushrooms, and jump in one of them.

**4.** We break open the little shack with obsidian, which was reinforced with iron.

**5.** LunisequiouS comes in, and says he wants to talk. He gets killed by the group I teamed up with. I was fine with this, since he's the guy that started this all; and I'm not too happy with Dimension Claimers D:

**6.** We proceed to the main island, and take down a few crystals here, we died a few times, but managed to get back most of the stuff we had.

**7.** We kill the Ender Dragon. Yes, there were 2 Ender dragons, but strangely enough, one of them just vanished once we killed the other one. He's gone now, we don't know where it went.

**8.** The Ender Egg get's taken by the group I teamed up with. They'll be keeping the Dragon Egg safe, so it will be placed on a good spot where it can be seen by everyone! Until then, we'll protect the Egg, not because of selfishness, but so we can prevent it from being destroyed by griefers/wanderers.

**9.** The End is open for everyone now, and everyone is free to be there! If The Technocracy of Omnitopia tries to claim the end again, Greyshore will declare war on The Technocracy of Omnitopia. 

Hm. I think that's about it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the comments!

We will probably get all kinds of posts like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2kfhou/theft_in_greyshore/) where it is unclear who stole or griefed something. This way people can't take matters into their own hands and can only name some suspects. I suggest an anti-griefing/snitches plugin with which people can see who stole what items or broke which blocks. Please enter your preferred option in [this poll](http://vote.pollcode.com/31584528#sthash.gxT9Omgf.dpuf).

* There is currently no anti-x-ray plugin. To give everyone the same advantage I suggest using a anti-x-ray plugin, that way everyone will play Minecraft the way it is meant to be played. I don't see any reason to not want a plugin that stops x-ray but here is a [poll](http://vote.pollcode.com/81151425#sthash.UuthJByc.dpuf).

* There is no way to punish someone who griefed your city. In CivCraft people don't grief cities that often, why? Because if they grief a city and they find out who did it they will pearl him. The only real way to punish someone is to kill them but that really won't stop a griefer from putting lava or DRO all over your town. My suggestion is to implement some sort of pearl-like/prison system. In combination with the snitches plugin towns can actively punish griefers and thiefs which will result in less griefers and thieves. Please vote on [this poll](http://vote.pollcode.com/11238181).

* Last but not least there currently is no protection available to make sure a griefer won't put lava buckets all over your city. I suggest the Bastion plugin for that. Another [poll](http://vote.pollcode.com/88557461).

Yes I am aware that at the moment we probably won't have that many thefts or griefers in the server, but the more popular this will become the more these sorts of plugins will be required. I think that if we install these plugins now we will be ahead of potential griefers. It would be a shame if some city got completely ruined because we can't protect it properly. 

Well these were my two cents on this subject. I'm quite curious what you guys think about all of this. Just.. don't underestimate a griefer, you have to make it a bit of a challenge for them too ;)

I'm writing this post to inform you all of some recent events in Greyshore. Someone broke into my(takshi80) house and daddo69 house, and stole numerous valuable items. A sign was left at the door of my house saying ""creeper slayer was here"", however I have reason to believe that he did not leave this sign.

If anyone has any information on who has committed this crime, I'd appreciate it if they could let me know. Thanks for your help!

I see many people around here struggling with surviving, which I can understand; This server is difficult, and unforgiving. I'll be writing down a small guide that might help you out with surviving!

* **Get a bed!**
 * Sleeping in a bed will prevent you from respawning on a random location.

* **Hunger**
 * It's difficult getting food in this world, since there aren't unlimited animals (Unless you breed them ofcourse). Because of that, I'd advice getting seeds and settings up farms early into the game. You can find the growth rates of plants [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ck6CiD9535bsH0WIVyM8kPA2dCxFxZkXdblMywprDG4/edit#gid=859568913).
 * I also don't recommend sprint jumping if you don't have any food, your hunger bar decreases extremely quickly then. (Difficulty is set on hard)

* **At night, you've only got 4 things you can do (That won't get you killed), when you're early into the game and don't have armour:**
 * Go mining. (Remember the ore generation [guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ck6CiD9535bsH0WIVyM8kPA2dCxFxZkXdblMywprDG4/edit#gid=859568913)!)
 * Craft a boat, and go sit on a river, if there's one nearby.
 * Also a possibility if you have access to alot of coal: Just simply light up the area you'll be staying for the night.
 * Log out.
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't stay above ground if you don't have the area lighted up with torches. You'll die, I guarantee it.**

* **Join a organization/government!** 
 * Socializing is one of the most important things, so you can work together to complete difficult tasks faster!
 * [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2jwedu/list_of_all_groups_on_this_server/) a list of  all the groups on this server!

* **Don't make stupid decisions**
 * Seriously. They'll get you killed fast.

While I know this is common sense for many people, I think there might be some people out there who will profit from this guide :)

Well, that's it. If we make any big changes to the server, I'll probably post it on the subreddit. If you have any questions, feel free to post them below. Also, big thanks to /u/goldenappleguy, /u/yourself797, /u/mbach231 and

My personal suggestion, seeing how the ores spawn, would be as follows.


Scarcity levels in decreasing order
* Redstone &amp; Diamond (redstone ores are rarer, but they drop multiple)
* Emerald 
* Gold
* Iron
* Lapis
* Coal

.

so, i propose
* 1 diamond = 1 redstone
* 1 diamond = 4 Emeralds
* 1 diamond = 8 gold
* 1 diamond = 16 iron
* 1 diamond = 32 lapis
* 1 diamond = 64 coal
* 1 diamond = 128 SmoothStone
* 1 diamond = 256 cobble

This is, however, a problem with the plugin. The growth times are simply *too* long. The only things that this does it make it hard for newcomers to get a stable food supply, and require players to create giant farms to feed themselves.

Lets imagine that you have a relatively small city with ~5 players on at a time. The city is situated in a plains biome, and has not yet put clay under their crops.

Assuming a player consumes 11 bread per hour of playtime, the player needs 33 wheat per hour. Since wheat needs 3 hours to grow, it takes 99 wheat crops in a plains biome to produce 11 bread per hour.

This is already a problem, as setting up enough wheat early-game for a single player can be a big deal. 

Since the city has 5 players on at a time, they will need a bigger bread output to feed the whole city. To produce 55 bread per hour, the city now needs 495 wheat plants growing in their city field. Round that up to 500, and you realized that a city needs a 25x20 field to sustain itself on a lean diet, assuming the are lucky enough to get a plains biome. 

Keep in mind that these are conservative computations. If a player needed to eat, say, 20 bread in an hour, the city would need a 900-block field.

The Amani Kingdom (Amanians) will be located in the warmer biomes this world has to offer. Our Kingdom will be created from the dust and sand of the desert into a glorious beacon of light. We will guard our borders of the desert at any cost and create a city to be reckoned with. 

As previously mentioned, the idea of this city is to create a wealthy metropolis in the desert and mesa biomes. Most people refrain themselves from these sort of places. We however will take the challenge. Let’s mine all the gold this world has to offer and try to build a community where every individual is respected and able to flourish.	

Our government will be a socialistic Kingdom lead by a single person: the King or Queen. That saying we will have strict regulations and laws, for instance:


* Building layouts: to create a good looking city there will be [examples](http://img.youtube.com/vi/j2vitrhl3T0/hqdefault.jpg) of layouts for houses people can choose from. Some building material will not be allowed while other building material will be highly recommended;


* Every last day of the month the King can be dethroned by the people if his actions are immoral, unwise or lead to general dissatisfaction. After dethroning the King the person with the most followers or support will become the new King;

* The King is freely to listen to his people or advisors but always has the last word in the decision-making process;

* There will be specified what land is for housing, monuments, industry, agriculture, shops etc. That way we won’t have all sorts of buildings chaotically spread throughout the city. 
* The King can decide what sorts of projects must be started for instance the building of a wall or the start of a gold mine. People are free to apply to these projects and do what they like.  
* The King can freely choose his own advisors and even give them responsibilities over projects or certain aspects of the city.

All these laws and/or regulations should ensure the prosperity of the city.

So do you have the ambition to become a King or Queen, would you love to build a city in the midst of the less-wanted biomes or do you simply like a challenge? Then apply for the Amani Kingdom.

The Citadel has a built-in 'acid block' plugin, which allows players to reverse reinforcement grief by placing a gold block with a certain level of protection. 

This idea seems like a good deterrent to reinforcement grief in theory, but there are a few holes in it:

* To remove a DRO block, you need diamonds and gold, neither of which I have.

* The warm-up and cool-down times are so long, you might as well mine it yourself.

And we want to have international trade. And we want to be able to have a hike knowing what likes ahead. And we want to find a way to nearby towns when we randomspawn for the first time.

First, however, we need a map to do any of that stuff. In this thread, I will be looking for city coordinates and the rough locations of biomes. I will use this data to draw a rough map of the CivEx world. 

*Full community participation is needed to pull of a project of this magnitude.*

**PHASE 1:**

**I will find the coordinates of every city, and plot them on a grid relative to each other!**

Coordinates so far:  

* x5477 z11834 Golden Coast
* x4950 z3525 Revolution State
* x8200 z8500 Survival Union
* x4800 z11500 Amani Kingdom
* x5700 z7880 Equinox
* x9350 z6000 Sky Utopia
* x9003 z4357 The Reach (Super-Waffe's Home)

Coordinates needed:

* United Republic
* Moria
* Greyshore
* Elberfield
* Arcestir
* Nexus

**PHASE 2:**

**I will find the natural layout (biomes, rivers, etc.) of the area around each city, so we can eventually fill in an entire map of the world!**

Surround geography so far:

* Golden Coast [Map Link](http://imgur.com/TmzfdCt)

* Sky Utopia [Map Link](http://i.imgur.com/yfZxqHY.jpg)
* The Reach [Map Link](http://i.imgur.com/urIa4RY.png)

Surrounding geography needed:

* Survival Union
* Equinox
* United Republic
* Moria
* Elberfield
* Sky Utopia
* Arcestir

**RANDOM DATA:**

**Uncategorized stuff that will be useful in general.**

* The 'huge river' lets out somewhere in the North.
* River dead end at 4200, 6200
* River bank at 5555, 9732
* [Pie Crafted Map](http://i.imgur.com/pN88TgS.png)
* [Sandy Delta Map](http://imgur.com/a/vSxsE#0)
**PROGRESS:**

**Any versions of the map that I will make time to time, using the data.**

NOTE: On versions prior to 1.5, the top of the map is south.

The map so far:

* ~~[Version 1.0](http://imgur.com/tp3TxZc)~~

Which nations have already started developing roads/canals/rails to other nations? I think it'd be smart to start getting people thinking about the best ways to get cities connected before we start really getting into developing infrastructure.  
  
In the beginning, I think the smartest choice would be to have all roads/canals/rails connect to a single, central city (which would likely be Greyshore due to their location near-ish the center of the map). Every nation would only need to create a single line to a single city for now to achieve full-connectivity. Of course more paths will be be created later on in order to lower travel times (because of course it's faster to take a direct line to a city instead of having to switch lines in another city), but I think as long as we all can connect to one city, then we'll be able to travel to all other cities relatively easily and cheaply.  
  
This sort of project would also help bring trade between nations, as this sort of thing will require lots of materials (coal and netherrack for lighting; iron, gold and redstone for rails; saddles, horses and slabs for roads).

* Citadel: We've increased block-break requirements for Stone, Iron and Diamond to 32, 128 and 512 respectively. However, this does *not* mean your reinforced blocks have gone up in durability. If they were at 16/16 durability with Stone, they will now be at 16/32 durability with Stone.
* JukeAlert: We've increased the range on snitches from 5-block range to 10-block range.
* We've re-enabled suffocation damage. Apparently some people were being spawned in stone, which makes it rather annoying to mine out with your fists. We've decided to re-enable suffocation damage to handle this. Some people may die on spawning, but the chances are quite low, and we feel this is a simple solution to the (small) problem.

There have been quite a few discussions about griefing, and how we can prevent people from just randomly griefing cities and houses of people; While JukeAlert is a good step into this direction, we still feel like we need some more things that should be added to the server.

We will be banning players, if we find that they ruin the positive experience of this server, or remove it in any way. While you might ask ""But Phaxar, isn't this server supposed to be an 'Everything is allowed, nothing is wrong' server?"" Yes. It is, but we also want this community to have fun, ofcourse there will be wars sometimes, and problems between groups and governments. BUT, there are some players, who don't care about fun, and come here to ruin the fun of other people, and annoy them, without adding anything useful to the server. Civcraft experiences this problem alot, and has to deal with alot of HCF players; which some people just get tired of after a while; with them ending up in either quitting, or just having less fun. With banning players who are just ruining the fun of the game, people will be able to focus on the actual intention of this server, which isn't trying to murder and imprison people that keep fucking up your farms and buildings for no reason. It just causes a lot of anger :( Every time we think about thinking about banning someone  we'll carefully decide, since every case is unique and has different factors.

There have been quite alot of requests for a plugin like PrisonPearl or Prisonbed;  Or any imprisoning plugin in general. We've been discussing this with the staff together, and the banning solution is one of the things we'll add to the server besides adding a plugin like PrisonPearl. Sadly enough PrisonBed is outdated, and can't be used. PrisonPearl is likely to be the most suitable plugin for our needs, but we're always open for other plugins suggestions!

**Who Am I**

* 21 years old and mature. User name: Skeleton_Stalin

* Active on Reddit and will be on minecraft weekdays

* I work over 60 hours a week as an Executive Assistant as well as a self employed Business Owner so I'll only be on in the morning or evening for a few hours

* I enjoy role playing so bonus points if your city has a representative government with political parties. 

* In Civcraft I wrote books on histories in the game, collected and encouraged writing, owned companies and plantations, as well as encouraged the development of local economies and trade.

* Used to be in charge of a town of several people on Civcraft called /r/SkywatchCraft. I made a constitution there and helped organized the town into a Constitutional Monarchy.

* Used to be Chairman of a political party on Civcraft named the National Republican Party in a city called /r/CivCraftAytos that had several members. Here is a sample: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/CivCraftAytos/comments/1oy6vz/declaration_nationalist_capitalist_imperialist/

* Used to run a newspaper in Aytos that reported news which I enjoyed so wherever I go I'll probably do that again. Here is a sample:

**What I Want**

* I would like a town with a minimum of five other people but would prefer at least ten however I understand this is new so I have no idea what your town sizes are.

* Your town must be active on Reddit

* I don't mind teenagers much but I would prefer to be around adults

Since everyone is worrying about bots and vaults and stuff, how about this idea: A bank!


We could ""Hire"" many people and they would check on it every so often to make sure it's not being broken in to. A few trusted people would have access to it and it would be in a public space. Heck, every nation could have one. It should be maximum reinforced and would be a trustworthy place to store valuables.


ON A RELATED NOTE: How about stocks? Each country could have it's own stock and you could invest in some? This idea is very hazy and I would love you ideas!",5,CivilizatonExperiment,,685,23,Suggestion,bug

As it stands, right now, if a player made a 30-layer vault on the world-border (requiring around 7k diamonds), a player can break through this in a little over 6 hours. This means if I log on around 12am and setup a bot to tunnel down, I can be done a little after 6am, which means it's very likely that nobody would be around to stop me.  
  
This seems a little too easy to break considering the amount of time it would take a player to construct such a vault (admittedly, even after a vault's broken into, it's still useful with just a bit of repair). There are a couple ways we can go from here.  
  
* Don't make any changes: If players want to setup a bot and vault-break in the middle of the night, why shouldn't they be able to?
* Increase Citadel reinforcements: This will increase the amount of time it'd take to break into a vault. It'd also increase the time it'd take to break into any diamond-reinforced block; obby, chests, doors, *anything*.
* Ban botting: If players are caught botting, ban them! Bots tend to give an unfair advantage because it allows players to reap benefits even when they're not playing the game.
* Increase Citadel a bit and ban botting: Little of column A, little of column B.  
  
I feel like one of the reasons why having vault-breaks be such a huge deal on Civcraft is due to *who* is vaulted. HCF, devastating griefers and the like, most of which would likely be banned on this server. I feel as though many people who would end up in vaults on this server are innocents who don't belong there, or political prisoners. Are these the kinds of people players need to spend tens of hours of their time releasing?  

To help get an idea of peoples wants/needs, I pose this question: If your best friend or your nation's leader was locked away in a vault, how much time would you be willing to invest to save them (and by that, I mean let them be able to play on the server again)? 3 hours? 6? 10? 20? Please give as honest an answer as possible.  
  
If you have any other ideas as to how we can go about handling this conundrum, please post your thoughts. :)",12,CivilizatonExperiment,,2254,80,Announcement,announcement

This is not meant to bitch or complain, just asking for reasoning.  How many people currently have villagers or iron farms?

I will start be stating that I do have a working iron farm with villagers, it took roughly 10-15 hours of play to gather the needed resources, build the structure and cure the zombie villagers.

So we've been trying to come up with a couple ways to make gold and emerald more useful, we wanted to pitch to you what we've come up with after talking with a few players:  
  
  
  
**Emerald:**  

* Emeralds will be convertible into XP. When holding an Emerald while right-clicking the air, the Emerald will give the player between 3 - 11 XP (same amount as Bottle O' Enchanting), consuming the Emerald in the process.
* Emerald Blocks can be used as XP storage.
* To store XP, hold onto a single Emerald Block (having more in your hand will cause the XP to not be stored, this is to help prevent players from accidentally storing/retrieving XP) and right-click the air. If the player has enough XP (30 Levels worth), they will be detracted from them and stored into the block. The block name will be changed to ""Filled Block of Emerald"" and will be enchanted.
* To retrieve XP, player must be holding a single Filled Block of Emerald and right-click the air. This will give the player 30 Levels worth of XP, and the block will return to a normal Emerald Block. There is a 20% chance the block will shatter upon use.  

  
**Gold:**  
  
* Increase armor resistance against heat (will become the best armor against the heat)
* Increase armor resistance against cold (will become the 2nd best armor against the cold, 1st best is leather armor)
* Will be the item that PrisonPearl consumes to keep pearled players imprisoned. Amount per day isn't 100% decided, we're thinking something along the lines of 16 gold / day for now and seeing how that goes.  
 
  
These are just a couple ideas, please give us your thoughts! If people react poorly to this, we won't go through with it. But as it stands, emeralds are somewhat useless, and gold is only useful for a couple things.  For emerald in particular, this would enable players to be able to buy and sell XP, something that's currently impossible at the moment. We're hoping these little changes will help give more value to both emerald and gold, making them more desirable for trade.",9,CivilizatonExperiment,,2048,68,Discussion,discussion

There has been quite a lot discussion about /u/Piecrafted AKA JarretHoman. He's accused of using an alternative account and griefing. I could go through the whole situtation again, but this is the final decision of the staff on JarretHoman and his alt, buzzfix101:

* BuzzFix101 will be permanently banned.

 * We don't allow more than 1 account, and will never do so. 

* JarretHoman won't be banned.
 * We decided that since he paid back the costs he made to Sky Utopia by griefing it and Sky Utopia has also forgiven him. We won't ban him for alt account usage, since he apparently didn't log in with BuzzFix101 (The server logs have proven this).

After his grief of Sparta that burned down most of our forests that will take countless hours of work and double chests of trees/leaves to repair damage that he did in maybe 30 minutes I put a large bounty of 100d on every alt of JarrettHoman because two pearls account on Civ results in a ban until one is freed. **He was subsequently banned when one of his alts buzzfix101 was pearled.**

* Nether portals will properly transport NPCs to the correct portal.
* End portals will not transport NPCs.

I, and I'm certain most of you, don't think that [this is a fair claim to land](http://i.imgur.com/QKehBgu.png) (just a theoretical example). So to solve this, I've come up with the outpost system. **This is not a definitive ""rule"", is flexible and is based completely on honour and honesty**. If someone chose to, they could easily disregard this system as you can not follow laws or break a promise in real life. 

Basically, you would expand your territories by settling [outposts like this](http://i.imgur.com/xL8ARdw.png). Outposts can be anything from a tower to a fortress. However you can't do things like settle an outpost ridiculously far away from your [capital and claim everything as your land](http://i.imgur.com/6S9X3om.png). There's no exact block distance for this, but use common sense. If the outpost is really far away, [it would have a ""sphere of influence""](http://i.imgur.com/gt3uOFk.png) which is not a definite territory. People can still come and wreck things in the ""sphere"".

 Also, borders may overlap. What happens [here](http://i.imgur.com/qmIUhF0.png) is completely up to the two parties involved. They could allow open borders or go to war with each other. **And here's another thing, an outpost should be a fully grief-able structure with no locked doors and chests ect.** If you burn the outpost down or take it over then that could count as the person losing the territory. Finally, there needs to be a grace period for attacking an outpost. You must let the person know ahead of time before you plan to attack their outposts. This is not a little hit and run where you steal their iron, this is a full on rape, pillage and burn scenario. The person **MUST** be online when you attack them. If you tell them on reddit, make sure they got the message and they know. This just makes this more fair and fun. **As I said before, you do not have to follow these rules. If you chose to, you could pillage and burn someone's structures whilst they're on vacation, but that would be a dick move.**

We have a well established city in the region, a transportation network already in development, and plans for 3 further cities. We have a fairly large, active, and wealthy population. We have explored and left our mark over this entire region. As such we believe these borders are reasonable.

**IMPORTANT**

**new island being discussed. ignore this post**

Hello CivilizationExperimenters!

I have recently stumbled upon one of the mushroom biomes owned by Omnitopia. As it stands, they have claimed all of them and do not allow visitors. This is unfair to the general populace, because no one can use them.

Due to this fact, I am hereby claiming the land from Omnitopia. This island will be made public, and all my visit and may request permission to build small outposts there. 

All nations will be allowed (Even Omnitopia), as I feel everyone should have a right to visit the island.

I have several nations to back this, and I do not wish any conflict with omnitopia. 

Thank you all for your time, and I will post the coordinates for the island soon.(Leaders please post if I have your support)

**EDIT** I am only claiming this one island. The other 4 will not be taken from Omnitopia

**EDIT 2** Nothing on the island but a sign. I suspect underground snitches

As I'm surely many of you have noticed, diamonds are still pretty common on this server. Personally, I feel as though this detracts from the trade-aspect of the game. Having too much of one-of-the-best resources in the game makes things too easy.  
  
There's a couple ways we can handle this.  
  
* **Remove the Fortune enchantment:** I've personally found close to a stack of diamonds in a *single vein* using Fortune III. I hope I'm not the only one who believes this is absolutely absurd.
* **Limit the Fortune enchantment to rank I only:** People love their Fortune picks, which I totally understand. There are plenty of other resources that people want to use Fortune on besides diamonds. Why should everything else be limited due to one resource being in such abundance?
* **Limit the Fortune enchantment on diamonds:** Not sure how feasible this is, but maybe I could find/build a plugin so the Fortune enchantment doesn't work on diamonds. This way Fortune would still be available for players to use, but it would drastically help limit the amount of diamonds players can quickly acquire.
* **Do nothing:** We're too late, diamonds are already common and disabling Fortune at this stage would be unfair to people who haven't acquired any yet.  
  
If anybody has any suggestions on how to handle this, please pitch your ideas below. :)",3,CivilizatonExperiment,,1355,41,Discussion,discussion

I am changing Pado-Doshi into Elbeck, for both the sake of being easier to memorise and for cultural building reasons.

I am moving due to the difficulty of manipulating Jungle forests and for the more mild climate of the forests. I am also moving here because for the most part the swamps are uninhabited.

***XP Storage***  
  
* To store: Right-click the air with a single emerald block to store 30 levels worth of XP into the emerald block.
* To retrieve: Right-click the air with a single filled emerald block to retrieve 30 levels worth of XP. There is a 90% chance that the emerald block will be destroyed upon retrieval of the XP.
* You cannot deconstruct a filled emerald block into emeralds, nor can you place a filled emerald block.
  
~~***Emerald Experience***~~  
  
* ~~Receive XP from an emerald: Right-click the air with an emerald to receive between 3-11 XP. The emerald will be destroyed upon retrieval of the XP. Note that this will work with any number of emeralds on hand, you do not need to be holding just one. However, only one emerald will be consumed per right-click.~~

Its goals and if it *really* is what the majority of players play the server for.

---

* **1.** CivilizationExpeirment a social experiment.

Upon the side bar we are introduced to the question and purpose of this server: ""How would you react if you were put in a custom survival world, where everyone is trying to make the world civilized?""

This question is interesting, as for the most part, all the popular factions seem quite pleased with one another. There is already an established and civilized order among almost all the players. New players would enter and either be welcomed in or banished, this is where the problem comes in.

The recent events of RogueX7 and Onemoredesu have given us a new situation that the server had never experienced to such a degree, the world of raids, attacks, griefing and most shocking of all, acting in an *un*civilized manner.

Herein lies the problem. The server asks the question of how one would act and try to civilize peoples within a server? How can this question be answered if all the people are already civilized remain and those deemed unworthy or act in a brutal and uncaring manner are banned?

There is no opposition to this what is deemed civilized because all opposition is eliminated, thus there is no one to civilize.

(Tl;dr - World is civilized because rules do not permit an uncivilized group to enter such as griefers or bandits to commit their actions.)

* **2.** The Rise of Fantasy and Lore

Over my observance in the past couple of weeks I have seen the emergence of Lore, fantasy and even unique flags of the member states of the server. Now this is interesting, many acted positively and even inspired one another to create their own imaginary worlds, states of steampunk, tribes, and pirates, and introduce them to one another.

This has given a more roleplay influence on the server and its world.

I believe that more focus on the fantasies people have made are due to the world already being civilized. There is no need for war as resources are plentiful, there is a rule against griefing so there is no threat of attack or raid.

Are the rules truly acting in favor of answering the question that the server presents? I don't think so. The choice to ban greifers and bandits has had a serious consequence in terms on the 'Experiment' but has worked wonders to keep the server enjoyable and fun.

(Tl;dr - The creation of Lore and fantasy is to fill the gap of actual in-game conflict. The consequence of the 'banning griefers' kept the server players happy, but ruined the experiment.

---

In my eyes we are moving away from being an experiment. This is not a bad thing. 

In fact I would much rather pursue a different future for this server, a future that is already in play and exacerbating itself, a fantasy and lore server with our own politics and affairs separate from what the server presents itself to be.

---

If you disagree with me, I am sorry, please make your voice clear below in the comments.

We didn't spawn near Greyshore!",http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2n5w26/you_know_when_we_first_spawned_and_randomspawn/,"I was looking at piecrafted's map, and I noticed something. The geography of Greyshore does not match up with the geography of the area that we spawned. There are two forks in the river, one that Greyshore is built on, and one near Sky Utopia and the Survival Union.

When we spawned, we spawned on a sandy area, which is proof in itself that we did not spawn near Greyshore. However, it's now evident that we spawned on the Survival Union's delta.

Second of all, when I got to the fork in the river, I decided to go down a path with stone walls, and no gravel banks, which led to a dead end. A quick look at piecrafted's map shows an area with thin stone walls and no banks, that leads to a dead end.

In addition, when we spawned I pressed f3 to do quite a bit of navigation. I remember the spawn coordinates being at roughly x8000 z8000. These are the rough coords of the second fork.

Last but not least, the path to the huge lake was thin, long, and winding. It had many curves, and when it opened at the big lake, it came out on large stone cliffs. The area where the Survival Union part of the river empties? Large stone cliffs.

All this evidence points in one direction, that we spawned on the Survival Union delta.

&amp;nbsp;

We have chosen to create dozens of nations rather than banding together. **This has separated us and made us weak.** At any given time, very few people of one particular nation are online to defend themselves against potential griefers and assailants, and the rest are so isolated that it they would be unable to assist, even if they wished to.

&amp;nbsp;

As such, I hereby propose the creation of a United Army, with carefully selected and trusted members of all the nations, to enforce the peace and prevent acts of arbitrary destruction. These should comprise an elite force dedicated to maintaining the order and stability of the server against those who seek to harm it. 

&amp;nbsp;

They will not involve themselves in direct and official conflicts between nations, but will seek to punish and imprison criminals who act to damage the hard work of others.

&amp;nbsp;

This also includes the founding of a Central Vault, with contributions welcome from the entire server, in order to make the most secure prison ever designed to ensure these criminals never see the light of day again.

&amp;nbsp;

The army will be composed and overseen by leading representatives of each nation, forming the ruling body of the United Nations (which will be a democratic entity with control over the deployment of the army).

&amp;nbsp;

If you agree with this idea, please voice your support in this thread and we can start organizing ourselves further. Also accepting suggestions, critiques and volunteers.

The largest group of all were the Norths, living in the cold mountains, land of the Wind. In the burning desert, land of Fire, the Souths had settled down. Between East and West there were many settlements, all smaller than the Norths and Souths together. On a day, the Norths invaded all but the land of fire, populated by the Souths. The Norths had a mighty empire for eons, until one day, their leader was unexpectedly murdered by the Spider. The Spider, the only of its kind, was an enormous creature of Death, calm and friendly at day but deadly at night. It was invulnerable to sunlight, so the Sun couldn't harm it. Unable to choose a common leader, they were extremely vulnerable to another attack. To prevent this, Syntrivon - a hero, the strongest of the empire - went on a journey to defeat the Spider.

Syntrivon, coming from the taiga up north, had to cross the Gravel River, a river filled with dangers. Whilst crossing, he got ambushed by a creature of Death, the Sea Dragon. It came up from the darkness of the river, almost killing Syntrivon by surprise. Luckily, he had lightning-fast reflexes. He turned and strangled the creature to death with is bare hands. Enraged, Death turned the other sea creatures mad. They started attacking Syntrivon, who was only just saved by the Water God who turned the minds of the creatures back to normal.

Having crossed the river, Syntrivon continued his journey to the swamplands which the Spider inhabited. After weeks of walking and close escapes, Syntrivon found the Spider. He fought an epic battle with the Spider, but got exhausted after a week of battle. Trying to get help from the Gods, he managed to contact the Wind. The Wind flung him up in the sky. He landed on top of the Spider, crushing it into millions of smaller spiders, all with the same characteristics as their ancestor. The hero Syntrivon returned home, only to find that the empire had been split into several smaller nations, after having fought long battles over leadership.

If you look into the background of each of these original nations, you'll find enough variety for basically everyone. 8 is enough, maybe 9. Mkay?

Then, when the server was released, a few more nations joined the party. ""This isn't a bad thing,"" I thought. ""The more the merrier."" With things like Nexus and Sky Utopia, we would have a few more *interesting* nations added to the mix.

However, we now have *21* nations... and counting. It seems that half of the new people that join create a new 'country'. We have heaps of single-player claims and cities.

Please just join an existing city instead of creating a new one, I would rather have 4 highly-populated countries then 50 single-man nations. ",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,1239,60,Announcement,announcement

Essentially, there needs to be a human holding down the mouse when mining. This was added to make sure that people don't break into the DRO vaults for the pearls of dangerous criminals.

However, the time it takes to break through one layer of diamond-reinforced obsidian is 80 minutes, using a diamond pickaxe without any enchantments. This is ridiculous. As stated before, a player must be actually playing the game when breaking blocks, specifically into the vaults of people's ores and pearls. It doesn't matter how you look at it, no sane human could or would do the menial act of holding right click down for 1 hour and 20 minutes. 

Add multiple layers of obsidian to mix? Even worse. One could add a few more diamonds and obsidian and create a three-layer vault, requiring 4 hours of holding down a button on a mouse.

Now, consider the fact that griefers with large amounts of gold could simply pearl someone and stick them in a multi-layer vault (Think HCF), or the fact that stealing and raiding is a large part of the game, and that invincible chests remove the ability to seize items easily.

I think that due to this over-poweredness, *especially* when considering how common diamonds are, we should reduce the resistance of diamonds. ",0,CivilizatonExperiment,,1345,24,Suggestion,bug

The God GAM fishes in the ocean, as is his wont. A great and terrible Giant, who has no name, comes suddenly upon GAM, and strikes out at him. GAM is mortally wounded, but a true warrior, he stands tall. GAM hurls a blazing coal from his furnace at the Giant's feet, and they burst into flame, but it does not fall, and strikes at the god again. GAM hurls a block of ice from his bucket at the Giants brow, cracking it's skull and freezing it for all eternity, but the Giant remains upright, and strikes GAM once more. With his dieing strength, GAM strikes the giant in its heart, and it falls dead on its back, defeated. GAM, victorious, lies back in his boat, and dies.

  **The Cosmos**

  The Sky is GAM's boat, large enough for a god, it hovers eternally over the waters.

  The Sun is GAM's furnace.

  The Moon is GAM's Ice Chest.

  The night is stained black with GAM's blood, and shines with Stars, fragments of his beauty. 

  **The Land**
 
  As the Giant decayed, it's flesh became the earth of this world, and it's bones, the rock.

 The legs of the giant burned away, it's charred abdomen is the vast scorched deserts of the south-west, there is gold there. The ash drifted east, and formed the peninsula of the south, with fertile soil sprouting a great forest.

  As it putrefied its belly burst, and it's intestines spilled out into the Western seas, they are the maze-like swamps of this world.

  Its arms, spread out in death, are the huge peninsulas of the North-West and South-East. 

 Its spine stretches as a mighty mountain range from the South-West to the shattered skull, in the North-East, which forms the rugged and frozen terrain we call home. 

  It's blood pouring out carved those paths now taken by the rivers of the world, except for the Icelock river, which was carved by the Giant's tears. 

  Where GAM struck the giant is a large lake, some say the giant's stopped heart still lies just under the surface. 

  To the west of the lake the giants spine was broken by the force of the god's strike, and a pass through the mountains exists.

GAM's coal is said to still burn in the North-West, and his ice still chills the North-East.

**The Peoples**

  Most of the peoples of the world were born of the Giant's lifeblood, and settled near the waterways, in the good and fertile places. 

  The Greyshorians arose from the Giants heart blood, and still live on the mightiest river, they are traders.

  The broken spine of the Giant leaked marrow, from this arose the Amanis, dwarven, like but unlike ourselves, for they have not been shaped by the cold of the North-East.

  To the East of the heart-lake, the Giant's ribs cracked and the breath in it's lungs was released. This formed the Utopians, disgusted by the ground and entranced by the sky, they seek to return to the air whence they came.

  But the first person arose from the first drops of bone or marrow, where the skull was cracked, MBACH was born, and shortly after the other Morian dwarves. We died nearly as soon from the cold, and have survived only by delving deep into the rocks, rocks formed from the skull of a Giant, and we have found many good things there. 

  Another strange peoples are sometimes found in this world, unique in that they are not of the substance of giants. In the titanic fight, GAM's fish spilled into the sea, there forming rotting islands, coated in mold, and sprouting huge mushrooms. The Omni were born here, and have since spread their strange mushrooms to 3 other places on the mainland.

&amp;nbsp;

From the chaos that was the [Void](/r/minecraft) came the First Phrophet [Gaemius](/u/Gamesison). He foretold the creation of a marvelous land of many nations who would grow to form mighty civilizations and in times of peace and war develop and trade amongst each other, in eternal pursuit of progress and the betterment of Minekind. This messiah then vanished into the Void from whence he came and was never seen or heard from again.

&amp;nbsp;

The God of Order, [Bacchus](/u/mbach231), moved and intrigued by the tales of this mortal and similarly endowed with the gift of prophecy, decided to see his vision to fruition. To this end, he made the Simulacrum, the One True Server, fashioned out of his own substance and filled it with the [Sacred Codexes](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2jvv1d/server_release_update/), which governed the rules and workings of his own universe.

&amp;nbsp;

Yet the world was still shapeless and bereft of life and for this, he enlisted the aid of the God of Creation, [Ipsus] (/u/Yourself797) whose power was used to shape the World itself. Ipsus made flow oceans, lakes and rivers of clear waters, raised the mountains and valleys and mesas that would yet challenge many mortals, and in accordance to the instructions of Bacchus, filled them with bountiful ores spread distinctively throughout the land, and so too commanded the winds to blow a freezing gale over any men foolish enough to attempt to brave their heights. Life flourished in this glorious land and many trees and animals made their homes peacefully within the many forests and plains of this wondrous land.

&amp;nbsp;

And although the world was peaceful for a moment, Bacchus sat in contemplation of his newest creation and this he was heard to say: ""Behold the glory and orderliness of my creation! Yet it is not complete, for it is foretold that many mortals shall yet walk this land and shape it according to their own designs. They too must prove their valor, however, and rise above the many challenges I shall set before them and prevail, so they too will come to understand this glory"". And so the many monsters and dark creatures that plague this world were born.

&amp;nbsp;

This world he named ""Civitas Experimentus"", though this name was long lost to the ages and we now know it as simply: *CivilEx.*

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**Genesis, II:**

&amp;nbsp;

His labors fulfilled, all that remained was to populate his creation with the many souls who would inhabit and later reshape the world. To this, Bacchus, already weary from his endeavors, entreated his confidant, [Phaxorum](/u/phaxar), the Lord of Trade to spread the word of this mighty new land to all the corners of the universe, that brave wanderers and forlorn, wayward souls might come seeking riches and adventures and so populate the cosmos and multiply, and thus fulfill the prophecy of erstwhile days. The task of documenting and analyzing the progress and ventures of these people he gave to [Aureum Pomum](/u/GoldenAppleGuy), Lord of Scribes, who watches from afar the conflicts and strife of Minekind, writing and cataloguing their history in his endless scrolls.

&amp;nbsp;

The Great Gods and Lords, their great tasks designated, chose to mingle with these mortals whom they loved so. Bacchus, mightiest of the Gods, journeyed to the coldest mountains in peregrination, and now serves as a beacon to the bravest souls who dare face the deadly frost to achieve enlightment at his side, and build mighty halls of stone and gems for his glory. He watches his creation from afar, ever changing it subtly in order to better accomodate the original prophecy. Phaxorum, Lord of Trades, founded the Silver Havens, known as Greyshore in the common tongue and instructs his people in the ways of crafting and trade, yearning to be greatest city of all at the very center of the world. Ipsus and Aureum Pomum wander the land ever and anon, communing with nature and silently observing the doings and movements of lesser beings who struggle to get by in these oft arduous expanses.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus was the world made, shaped and colonized, and the Genesis now draws to a close, for the prophecy is well underway and the Gods alone know what the future holds.",8,CivilizatonExperiment,,4296,22,,
159455237,2mxog5,1416531368,1,0,Kittenbears88,The 'Nexus' Creation story. A little different to most...,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2mxog5/the_nexus_creation_story_a_little_different_to/,"Hey, since us Nexus folk moved here you've had a few other people come along and *warn* you about us, or generally cause a bit of a fuss about us being here. So while everyone is sharing their 'birth of a nation' stories I thought I'd fill you all in on who we are, and what we are about.

Nexus started, as most of you by now know, on the Civcraft server. We were born by a glorious hero known as Dill_Weasel, may his spirit live on. And well he wasn't very well liked on Civcraft, his entire reason for joining that server was to continue a vendetta from *another* server. Sigh. Anyways, Dill_Weasel and his band of merry men failed in their ventures alone, so enlisted the help of some not-so-nice people known to most as 'HCF'. Yeah, Dill went and called in the big guns. 

So while Dill is having his little rampage the rest of us Nexus folk really didn't care. All we wanted was pretty things, and to be a city reknown across the server for beauty and efficiency (I'd argue we completed this goal as we were exceptional at manufacturing goods and our city looked fantastic), but HCF wars got in the way a bit. 

Myself and a couple other members of our town gave Dill a hand with his HCF friends by giving them materials and weaponry to continue their assualt on the server. Wrong decision but I'm known for sticking by my friends, wether they are in the right or the wrong. This was all kept secret for over a year, the server had suspicions but never was able to pin it onto us fully.

Fast forward a bit, Dill leaves Civcraft, I keep up relations with certain HCF people and supply bits and peices when they needed it. Nexus (at this point renamed to Vale) was prosperous, we were at the height of our glory. We built fantastic contraptions that were recognized across the entire server. People came tens of thousands of blocks to marvel at Jackson8960's automated reed farm, the product of hundreds of hours of work. Utilising TEN THOUSAND pistons and almost 30,000 redstone to create. We built libraries, huge market places and fantastic train stations. We revived dead cities and breathed new life into them, we became ludicrously wealthy and forged alliances server wide.

But then it all came crumbling down, a Judas among us betrayed our secrets, serving us to the masses of Civcraft on a plate. The actions of myself and only a few others caused the downfall of our city. In the span of only a few days 16 months of work was thrown away, purely because we held onto a grudge that wasn't rightfully ours.

And so we left Civcraft, we handed our city over to a trusted friend to carry forward. And we came here looking for a new slate, new friendships and to make our mark on this server.

But do not worry about our past. We are here only to create beautiful cities and to redifine ourselves. We are not a warring nation and we will not take arms against anyone innocent. We will aid any of you should you call on us, and we will only ever act in the best interests of this server as a whole.

We are Nexus. And we will not dissapoint you.",8,CivilizatonExperiment,,3054,33,,

So we've decided to place a ban on botting. **Any player caught botting will be permanently banned, no exceptions.** We feel this is necessary because botting breaks one of the fundamental aspects of gaming. That is, the more time that a person invests into a game, the more benefits they should have in-game (of course this isn't always the case, but in general, if I've invested 100 hours into a game and someone else has invested 1 hour into a game, I should be in a much better place than they are). Botting removes this aspect of gaming. As an example, I don't need to invest very much time at all in order to setup a macro to have my character be placed in front of an XP farm and earn XP all night while I sleep. Doing this night after night, it's possible for me to accrue a lot of XP, which is pretty valuable. Why should I be allowed to reap huge benefits while investing essentially 0 hours into the game, while other players are spending tens or hundreds of hours grinding to receive the same benefits?  
  
Currently, the server is configured to kick idle players. A player is considered idle if the server does not receive any of the following actions from the player within 10 minutes:  
  
* WindowClick
* ButtonClick
* UpdateSign
* BlockDig
* Place
* BlockItemSwitch
* ArmAnimation
* EntityAction
* ClientCommand
* Chat
* UseEntity  
  
This means that even if a player is in motion (like sitting in a stream or in a minecart), they will be booted if they do not perform any of the above actions. Simple things like walking, chatting, or even just moving your mouse will prevent you from being idle.  
  
So what exactly does it mean for a player to be botting? **If a player is using any out-of-game mechanics to prevent themselves from becoming idle, they will be permanently banned.** This includes (but is not limited to) scripts, macros, key-binding, glitches and weights on your mouse. As a rule of thumb, **if you are not playing the game, you should not be benefiting in-game**.  
  
I'm sure there are many players who can justify why botting should be allowed. ***We don't care.*** We don't want botting here. If you're not willing to put in the time or the effort to play the game, **then don't play.**  
  
If you have any questions regarding whether or not something is allowed, just ask us! We would never punish a player for asking us whether or not something is considered botting. However, if you simply go ahead with something questionable and we catch you botting, you will be banned. I promise you it'll be far better for you to ask permission now than to ask for forgiveness later.  
  
EDIT: Just to clarify because some people seem to be misunderstanding this. This does not mean any player who goes AFK will be banned. When a player goes AFK, as long as they're not using any external means to remain in-game, they will be kicked from the server, **as has always been the case from the beginning of the server.** ",8,CivilizatonExperiment,,2963,50,Announcement,announcement

The Lava then created the Overworld, which coexisted with the End, but never overlapped.

Finally, the Wind shaped the Elements and their gods; Fire, Water, Earth, the Sun and the Moon. He also made himself and the Lava lords of wind and the lava itself, respectively. The Earth Goddess ruled over the Overworld, the Water over the Seas and Oceans. Together with the Lava, Fire formed the Nether. The Sun and Moon, brother and sister, went to the opposite sides of the planet, and started chasing each other. But because their power was equal, they always remained opposites. They caused night and day, light and darkness. At night, the End overlapped with the Overworld, transferring some of its creatures to there. At day, the creatures slipped back to their homeland, scared of the light and water.

On a day, the Earth built two sculptures on the ground. The Water came and and let his streams flow through one of the sculptures, creating Life. The Lava came and let its lava flow through the other figure, creating Death. Life went on and populated the Overworld with animals, plants and humans. Sun used his powers to help Life and make the plants flourish. Everyone loved Life, which made Death jealous. He took the oldest and sickest humans and gave humans the power to kill each other. He then sent them back as minions, to kill more humans. This saddened Life and angered the Sun. The Sun started burning every undead being he saw at day, in revenge. Burned undead were banished from the Overworld.

You try patching it up the best you can, but in the process you lose tons of nonrenewable resources. How is this fun or challenging? I propose alternatives.

1. Turn mob griefing off completely
2. Make creeper explosions blast blocks in the air, and not just disappear.
3. Make them only damage blocks if you attack them.

While number 1 is you can do with one command,  2 &amp; 3 would require plugins. I am not sure if we have a developer working here, or if there is a plugin out there for them, but they would still retain most creeper functions while allowing people not to worry about their house being blown to bits.

Also, this applies to endermen to. Their block placing adds nothing to  the game besides making the world more ugly.

So, you might've noticed we're looking for more moderators, because of the current lack of staff. What would a moderator do? Well, it sure as hell isn't blowing up the server with /gamemode 1. What we're looking for, is people who are willing to dedicate some of their time on the server, to prevent players from griefing, by banning/kicking them. Additional tasks might be given when needed, if we feel like the moderator is capable of doing the task. 

Anyway, enough talking. We'll accept applications until **1 december 2014**, but we might make some people moderator earlier, since we're really in need of some moderators. Here's the list of questions you need to answer.

* **What is your minecraft account name?**

* **What timezone do you live in/Where do you live?**

* **Please tell us a bit about yourself!**
	
* **Since when have you started playing on the server?**

* **Do you have any experience as server administrator or moderator? If so, please elaborate.**

* **How would you contribute to this server by being a staff member?**

* **Do you have any shortcomings you feel like you can improve on?**	

* **Can you accept the fact that you must enforce the server rules and moderator guidelines under any circumstance?**	

* **How many hours would you be able to spend on this server every week?**

* **Do you have any interest in eventually becoming a server coder in the future? (We can't promise you we'll actually need them)**

* **Do you have any additional questions or comments?**	


Please send this form with all questions answered to **civilizationexperiment@gmail.com** with as subject **Civilization Experiment moderator application by [username]**. Please don't PM the application to me, reddit isn't exactly the best system for that :) If you have any questions, feel free to ask by PMing me or asking in the comments!

Just for the people who don't know what a greylist is = A greylist allows people to connect to the server and explore the server, talk to people and basically get an impression of the server, without the ability to place/break blocks.

If they want to play on the server, they'll have to apply.

If we enable something as a whitelist, they won't even be able to connect to the server.

###City of Arcis: Home of the Miners
---

&amp;nbsp;

*Arcis is looking for new members to help us become one of the biggest cities on the map. We offer a starter package to newcomers; read more about them a bit down. We are also working on a bunch of projects that are listed below in this post.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Arcis is being build under a large mountain in the North. It will be a home to the best miners and builders this world has to offer. Arcis' building style will be Dwarven/Dwemer, meaning there will be a an impressive amount of halls, long hallways and a lot of raw ore processing facilities.* 

&amp;nbsp;

*Other than trying to build one of the most beautiful cities in the world and gathering the most jewels we can get our hands on, we will also priotize the security of Arcis and the wealth of our citizens. We want to able to provide the maximum security possible to each and everyone of our citizens, and their accumulated wealth that is storaged in their bunkers.* 

&amp;nbsp;

--- 
###Starter Package
---

&amp;nbsp;

- *One stack of food (64 cooked steak)*
- *One filled emerald block (30 levels of experience)*
- *Full leather armor (to withstand the cold)*
- *Diamond tools (pickaxe / axe / sword / spade)*
- *One bed*

&amp;nbsp;

--- 
###Ongoing projects
---

&amp;nbsp;

- *The biggest project we're working on is constructing the central Arcis Railway Hub. This will help us to connect to other cities, allowing us to trade easier with other players. The Hub will have room for 8 connecting rail lines, 2 from each direction. (North / East / South / West)*

- *The second project is further reinforcing out infrastructure with Stone / Iron / Diamond and expanding our extensive snitch network.* 

- *The last project, but pretty importantly, is figuring out what kind of government we would like to be.* 

&amp;nbsp;

--- 

###Building Materials
---

&amp;nbsp;

*The following building materials will be used a lot to construct the city:*

* *Stone bricks / Stone / Quartz blocks / Emerald blocks*
* *Dark oak wood / Spruce wood*
* *Glowstone / Redstone lamps*
* *Vines / Leaves*
* *Green stained Clay*
* *Lava streams / Water streams*
* *Giant mushrooms*

&amp;nbsp;

--- 
###City Rules
---

&amp;nbsp;

1. *Don't steal*

2. *Don't be an asshole*

3. *Build in the same style and use the determined building materials*

&amp;nbsp;

--- 
###How to Apply
---

&amp;nbsp;

*We're looking for mature, experienced and most importantly, friendly players that are interested in most of the above. Arcis currently has and will also in the future have a lot of community projects, so we're looking for teamplayers, and not lonewolfs.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Interested in more information or perhaps even joining?*

&amp;nbsp;

*Visit our [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Arcis) or PM me!*

I want to hear the communities thoughts on it and its feasibility in CivEx. 

The Custom Gear plugin would allow users to expand upon vanilla gear. Using craftable recipes players could upgrade their armor and tools to give off certain status effects. By placing a diamond chest plate in the crafting table and several stacks of magma cream the player would create a diamond chestplate enchanted with custom lore. Which when combined with the full armor set would give them fire resistance for an indefinite time. The custom gear would suffer with a lower durability requiring constant repairs. This could also time into realistic weather by allowing armor to be made that could resist extreme climates. Of course we can't allow those in diamond armor to run around in speed II all the time so the custom enchantments could only be applied to certain gear.",2,CivilizatonExperiment,,958,14,,

Just click the link to get to the Amazon home page and use it like normal, it's that easy. :)   
  
Considering how the holiday season is quickly approaching/is here, I'm hoping this means many of you will be purchasing gifts for friends and family. I hope you'll consider using our Amazon Affiliation for every Amazon purchase you make. :) The more people spend, the more we'll have for hosting the server. I definitely intend on doing as much of my holiday shopping using Amazon because of this, I hope other people will consider the same (cause, hey, if I'm going to be buying gifts anyways...).    
  
I'll be looking into setting up some account so people can donate to us directly in the very-near future. We've already begun looking at different server hosting options, we'll likely be making a switch in the very near future. Stay tuned!

Most of them just make things more efficient which reduces scarcity and all of that. However, one key feature of FactoryMod was the gold tool/armor factories. It made actually using them viable because they were produced in large numbers and were automatically level 2 enchanted.

Now, I worry that gold won't see enough use due to griefer bans -- I don't think vaults will be used nearly as heavily as they are on Civcraft, which means the gold cost won't be all that high. Gold will be used for powered rails, but that's an extremely niche market for something that is basically the only benefit to settling in the desert. 

Essentially, my suggestion is just to add in a plugin that allows special treatment of gold tools and armor like we have on Civcraft, so that people will actually use them and so that gold becomes more useful.

(Either that or buff desert in other ways)

We have been given plugins to semi prevent griefing and theft it all just depends how much in terms of resources you are willing to put in to protecting your items. Imagine setting up a house and reinforcing with iron diamond or even stone protection. Not many people are willing to have to mine 60000 times to only take out a hundred or so blocks. However people would be willing to break reinforced chests if there is prospect of loot. Make vaults to protect your chests or log off with valuables.

In a civilization you don't choose who you want to be able to partake in it, take schooling for instance you can't just say well I don't like this guy so he can't be at my school! If the guy at the school however commits a crime he gets expelled or punished. Now apply this to this server. Place snitches networks everywhere you want to keep safe and on paths so you can see griefers coming. Report it and put a bounty on them, they will eventually be pearled and confined to the end. When this happens they will be stuck there and won't be able to destroy your creations. 

This is a civilization not an RPG no grief no raid no pvp server. Pvp, Raiding and griefing are all necessities to keeping this server successful. For example lets say someone is ruling your city with an iron fist. How do you rebel? I mean you can't hit them or steal from them and cut off their power supply instead you have to say in chat ""plz no fisting"" :)

I've been playing on the server for a while now, along with some good friends of mine and I figured it would be a good moment to start a discussion on what plugins to remove/add, aswell as what to tweak.

Disclaimer: Some suggestions have been proposed by other people, but I thought it would be a good idea to come up with a complete list of possibilities. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 1 - Prevent the use of xray**

This has absolute priority if you'd ask me. I know we tried Orebfuscator, but there are alternatives to check if people are using xray. The server is getting more and more attention (hence the recent wave of griefers) and I am sure rotten apples will join the server, if they haven't joined already.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 2 - Decrease monster spawn**

Decrease the amount of mobs spawning. There are several plugins to achieve this, and this will net in a performance boost. There's no need for 10 skeletons, 10 zombies and 10 creepers walking outside my base, nor the 50 squids that are chilling in the river when I am travelling by boat. Not only will this increase the performance of the server, it will also make some items rarer (e.g. ink sacs) and result in a more interesting economy. ( People living near water will be able to start a new business)

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 3 - Allow afk'ing**

Please re-allow afking. There are already a bunch of rail lines constructed that take quite a while to travel, and I don't see the problem afk'ing these rail lines. You're not actually accumulating any in-game wealth doing so. If there's anyone out there that actually enjoys sitting behind his computer and watching the minecart move along the rails, please stand up and show yourself, because I don't know anyone. The other server that shall not be named actually has a plugin that kicks people based on the amount of players online. 

100 players online = Kick after 5 mins afk'ing

10 players online = Kick after 60 mins afk'ing

&amp;nbsp;

This also applies to farms, let's say a cacti farm. Are we really suppose to walk around and pretend like we're playing the game, just waiting for the cacti to grow.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 4 - Sharpness / Protection**

This has been brought up several times already. The removal of the protection enchantment and the sharpness enchantment still being in the game has created a huge gap. I am not too sure on the exact values, but it has been said that a Sharpness 5 / Fire Aspect 2 sharp will two-shot a player in diamond armor. Even if we double that, that's only 4 hits. We should look at re-adding the protection enchantment or removing the sharpness enchantment. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 5 - More staff**

Now although the active aswell as the inactive staff of this server has done a phenomenal job so far setting up the server and steering in the right direction, I feel like the amount of work they're responsible for is overwhelming (especially after this post). Especially since the server is getting busier, it would really benefit the server to recruit a few active and motivated staff members. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 6 - Item Exchange**

If there's one thing I love about civilization servers, it's the amount and diversity of marketplaces and mall that people are capable of constructing. The argument has been made that adding such a plugin will lower the interaction between players when completing a trade. Although this is true, it's also tedious to force people to these kinds of trades for like smoothstone / iron / food. I'd love to be able to set up a shop for bulk items so I can actually go mining and inform people that they can visit my shop for these items. Also, hoppershops are ugly. :(

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 7 - Combat Tag**

I don't believe such a plugin has been added yet, but I could be wrong on this matter. We'd definitely need one when shit hits the fan and it comes down to PvP.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 8 - Unobtainable blocks**

Someone already made a post about this, but included nevertheless. Blocks like mossy coble, cobwebs. Would be awesome to have them in-game, but the implementation of those blocks would have to be discussed.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 9 - Clear rules**

Already being worked on by the staff, but still highly wanted. When is something allowed and when is it bannable.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 10 - Decrease chat range to 500**

Because of the size of the map and the amount of towns, I am sometimes able to hear people from 6-7 different towns.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this post will start some kind of a discussion, where we can come up with an overview on what to add / remove / tweak as a result. ",6,CivilizatonExperiment,,4679,39,Suggestion,bug

---

***How To Make Snitches***

The way to make snitches is placing either a Noteblock or jukebox and reinforcing it with any material. If you reinforce it to a citadel group, anyone on that group can check the snitch, however only mods on the citadel group and the owner can remove the snitch.


***Types of Snitches***

**Noteblock**

Noteblocks are the cheapest and most common snitch, however not the most efficient. They only alert you when someone comes in to the radius, and DO NOT record block breaks, block places, ignitions, and openings. They are good for a perimeter set up, when you have areas around the base where there is nothing to grief but would be good to know if someone was approaching.


**Jukeboxes** 

The most efficient and cost effective of the two, this type records block places, block breaks, ignitions, and openings, AS WELL AS doing what noteblocks do by alerting when someone is in the radius. 

Do /jalist to check the snitch logs for griefing and such. It also pencils in entry along with alerting in live time.

***Radius***

Snitches activate when someone comes in to the 11 block square radius, meaning 11 blocks above, below, to all sides, and everything in between. It's imparative to pay attention to the radius when making a jukebox network, and even note block network, to reduce overlap and increase effectiveness.


***Culled Snitches***


Snitches stop being active when the owner/moderators of the citadel group the snitches are on do not enter the radius in a set amount of time.

Noteblock cull time: 4 weeks

Jukebox cull time: 2 weeks 

To check how much time the snitches have, do /jalist and find the relevant snitch.


***Naming the Snitch***

Directly after reinforcing, it is smart to name the snitch doing /janame [name] when in the radius. When it alerts in live time, it will say ""[player] entered snitch at [name] [coordinates]""

Without a name, it will say the exact same thing but with a blank where ""name"" should be, so name those snitches so you don't have to remember exact coordinates of every outpost and such!


***Full list of Juke Alert Commands***

*I mean come on.*

There is no stealing of ideas. If someone wants to do what you are doing, let them. Let me remind you that this is a small server with only 20-30 daily players, not some big  triple-A server where you can be rude towards someone and never see them again. If someone makes a outlandish claim, let them keep the claim. The argument can be resolved by, if someone isn't or wasn't there it is mine. This is a completely legitimate claim of reasoning for this.

Anyway, subject of the post. My new project, the Olympian Metro System, will be a rail line catered towards convenience. It will connect all towns willing to participate in one public network of rail lines, with easy access points throughout the map. Right now it is in just the planning stages, with just me, but I do plan on making it a reality within the next month. It will be built by myself and any volunteers. Also since apparently redstone is rare, I may need donations for that.

When it is done I will release a metro map, with participating cities and Rail lines. Leaders of towns interested in joining please comment below to make my life easer.

I will admit, I did break into their place. But only to get my leads back.

Explanation:

 Two days ago Gorelexx sent me and coco to the end to mine obsidian. During this time, he teleported me back to give me a pickaxe to mine faster. He happened to be at Arcis at the time, and I was amazed at how clean and elegant it looked. When me and coco were finished mining the obby, Rosebush232 and I went over there to check it out some more. I saw the glass at the top of the mountain, and noticed they had villagers. Wanting to see what they offer, we went in and saw the trades. One of the trades happened to be a saddle. Since Rosebush232 was looking for a saddle, but had no diamonds to buy one, me and her were trying to collect emeralds to get it. Firstly, we had to open that trade since it was locked. One of the other trades he had opened was raw beef. We knew outside there was a cow farm, and we breed the cows and killed one parent, leaving more cows then there were before we started. That opened up the saddle trade, and gave us a bit of cash to get the saddle. But we needed more. We went to their wheat farm and took it and replanted it, since this is allowed in most cities. We now had enough to buy the saddle, and we had one leftover emerald, which we put in one of their chest as a gift. Fast forward one day later, I noticed I left a lead back the place. They told me it was private land by now, but I needed the lead to carry my horse across the river. I went back there and got it. Now today when I logged on, I saw my horse has been blown up, my horse is now dead or kidnapped, and our storage room has been griefed.

Damage: http://imgur.com/a/CsqS5

Chatlog: http://pastebin.com/08qUYnzA 

Note: I am not going to grief them. I was angry at the damage at the time. However, I am not going to tolerate this extreme over measure of damage for a simple ""crime"" if you could even call trading with villagers that. 

EDIT1: Apparently we just started a war. We planned to hold them hostage in a enderpearl until they gave up to reps, but they would not get on so we started killing cows and stuff as a threat. At the end of the day, all of their livestock and villagers are gone. Plus a few chest were stolen from them.",5,CivilizatonExperiment,,2293,42,Crime!,murder

In the past few days I've had a hankering to play some Skyrim. I'm personally a huge fan of games that involve exploring worlds, using magic and slaying dragons, so naturally, Skyrim is a perfect match for me.  
  
Instead of playing it, however, I decided to whip up a small plugin to see how much of the dragon-killing experience I could bring into Minecraft. :) All it does at the moment is allows for the Enderdragon to spawn in the Overworld and not cause massive amounts of damage.  The plugin can:  
  
* Spawn a dragon in the Overworld at a specific location, near a specific player, or near a random player.
* Disables the End Portal from appearing on the death of a dragon (XP still drops, Dragon Egg drop can be toggleable).
* Disables the dragons ability to destroy blocks it touches (cannot destroy the terrain, cities, etc).
* Disables the dragons noclip (so players can actually run into their homes to hide from dragon attacks).  
  
Would people be interested in having something like this added to the server? Usually when I join a new server, the enderdragon is long-since dead, which annoys me. I'm thinking maybe once a week or two we could have some random dragon attacks. If I can manage it, I hope to make some custom Enderdragons (Elder Dragon with x2 health, Fire Dragon that shoots fireballs at players, Twin Dragon that has slightly-lower health but always spawns in pairs, etc) just to help keep things fresh and interesting.  
  
Thoughts? Obviously if people don't find this interesting it won't be added. :)",23,CivilizatonExperiment,,1548,67,Discussion,discussion

I died.

We're capable of automatically replacing an illegal enchantment with the highest-level version allowed (in the case that all levels are considered illegal, then that enchantment will be removed entirely) without affecting any other enchantments that might be on the item. This is now enabled on the server. So this means any armor with Protection and any weapons with Sharpness III+ will be adjusted accordingly.
  
This also means that even if a player purchases illegal armor/weapons from villagers, the enchantments will be automatically removed. I'll potentially look into a way to just remove these villager trades altogether, but for now, you'll probably want to stop purchasing gear with disabled enchants from villagers. :)",10,CivilizatonExperiment,moderator,1543,23,Update,update

&amp;nbsp;

I was riding towards Greyshore just now to meet with someone from Sky Utopia when things start to lag and the server crashes.

&amp;nbsp;

30 mins later, server comes back on and I log in. I've rolled back to about 10 mins, no longer riding the horse and the horse is just gone, winked out of existence. That's because my player.dat file rolled back but the actual .mca files of the chunks didn't so the horse was missing from both. Good horse with nice stats, saddle and armor all vanish.

&amp;nbsp;

On account of these random crashes in the past, I've had several items duplicate, lost nearly my full inventory worth of goods twice and now a horse. Can we at least get a diagnosis of what the hell is going on with the server console so we can look into fixing it? As well, we need periodic and synchronized backups of player.dat and .mca files so that if crashes do happen, we can revert to accurate copies that won't lead to all these weird glitches and result in the loss of items.

And under it:
&gt;REV STATE WILL REIGN SUPREME

However, this grief was not done by the Revolution State, but by an impostor (according to RS).   
Later, that date was brought back (I don't remember where) as a threat.  
It left a few people (or at least me) thinking. What would happen on the 1st of December?  
And yesterday, on the 1 s tof December, /u/allliiisonnn from Omnitopia posted a picture of a pentagram^[2] titled **""The sacred ritual is almost complete""**. This was probably a coincidence, but still spoopy.

It's been two weeks since I made this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2nd88l/suggestions_for_the_server/) and I figured it'd be nice to have an update where we look at what has been fixed in the last two weeks, aswell as make a list of stuff people would like to see added.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**What has been added / tweaked:**

*Disclaimer: I am aware that other stuff also got tweaked, but these points were taken from the previous post.* 

&amp;nbsp;

- With the switch to Spigot, the use of xray should no longer be possible.

- Sharpness 3-5 has been removed.

- One extra staffmember: Akn

- Unobtainable blocks have been added; cobwebs / mossy cobble

- Rules explained / elaborated.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**Left out suggestions**

*Disagreed upon or not yet implemented*

&amp;nbsp;

- Whitelist / greylist not yet implemented and will probably never get implemented.

- Decrease monster spawn.

- Allow afk'ing.

- Item Exchange plugin. 

- Combat Tag.

- Decrease Chat Range to 500.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**List of suggestions:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 1 - Make sand a craftable material**

As Akn pointed out in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2onmis/i_love_this_server_and_its_world_but_theres_one/cmoul5e), it will only be a matter of time before the beaches and desert will be pillaged and destroyed.

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 2 - Combat Tag**

Has such a plugin already been added?

&amp;nbsp;

**Suggestion 3 - Despawning boats**

Add and/or configure a plugin that allows the millions of boats to despawn. 

&amp;nbsp;

In response to the terms of the ultimatum, we have deliberated on the issue and come to a decision on the matter.

Considering the time and effort required to settle this land and how entrenched we are, we will not be relocating our nation. We will also not be altering our borders/claim. We take our sovereignty and security very seriously in Outer Heaven.

We do however understand the value of the resources and spawners to the server and would like to welcome economic cooperation with the global community:

- We are open to trade agreements and will be happy to trade our supplies of ores and Packed Ice with other states. 
- We would like to discuss the possibility of a ""spawner access"" program; individuals could buy access to a spawner within our state for a discussed period of time and receive Outer Heaven escort to the spawner where they may use it freely during the duration of the arranged period. 

We think both of these suggestions would be beneficial to our nation and the world as a whole. Please feel free to respond and leave your thoughts.

We have finally decided on the name of our main island. I give you...

The nations: Omnitopia, Amani Kingdom, Arcis and 'the Rident' hereby want to openly contest the claim of  Outer Heaven because of the following reasons:

* Only claim with compressed ice generation;

* Vanilla ore generation which is extremely rare;

* Lots of mob spawners;

* Claim is huge.

We ask for Outer Heaven to take one of the two following actions:

A. Freely let people into their territory to use the mob spawners or mine for resources.

or

B. Unclaim a part of their island so people can go there for resources.

If Outer Heaven does not proceed one of these two actions we will wage war with them. If any of the other nations want to support this statement you can leave a comment below.

EDIT: Perhaps waging war is a bit too much, I don't want to be cruel to newcomers and perhaps they did not realise the rarity of the island before they claimed it.

The admins are already aware of most of these problems but for some reason they are more concerned with making dragon plugins rather than actually fix the problems currently affecting the server. I will show you not only what is broken, but how to ~~abuse~~ take advantage of these ""features""!

1. First on our list is strength potions. They are disabled on the server, or so we thought. Players can't throw strength potions nor drink them but that doesn't mean you still can't get the effect. [Here I show you how to use strength potions!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KX_uvUt6-c&amp;feature=youtu.be)

1. Potions of harming are very inexpensive. Next time you come up against an enemy soldier be sure to [splash them with a couple of these bad boys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW7d6xx8vl0&amp;feature=youtu.be) Just two is enough to send your enemy to the depths of the end.

1. Do you have certain blocks in your way? Would you love to just wish them away? [Well with this you can obliterate any block in your way, including bedrock! ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PftjlAHTEeo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

1. Running low on xp? Wish you had enough for just one more enchantment? [Well here I show you just how broken mbach's xp storage plugin is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orzxd5nsEE8&amp;feature=youtu.be) With this you can theoretically produce an infinite amount of xp!


I'm sharing this information for a couple reasons. I don't like holding information like this when I know it would give me a huge advantage in-game. I think the admins need to change their attention to actually fixing these issues instead of adding fucking dragons. Next post I will be sharing with everyone just how bad pvp has been ruined, how ridiculously weak citadel is, and what can be done to fix it. 

As an added second thought, **there is still nothing to prevent x-ray on the server.**",17,CivilizatonExperiment,,1977,55,,

^(Red, my approximate land claim)

^(Yellow, land being built in by an outsider)

I have recently noticed a new settlement that has been created within my territory. I would not mind that you continue to build there if you choose one of the following conditions:

1. That you incorporate your selves into Elbëck.

2. That you may continue to be independent, however that you must submit under Elbëck.

3. That you may build within your walled borders and no further in the territory, but you must make your farms with Elbëck.

If you would like to present another idea, I am all ears.

To check what hour is in your country, go to http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/  
___________________________________________________________

**Rules:**  
*Teaming IS allowed.  
*No breaking the glass dome or the Sky Utopian floor (stone slabs)  
*Everything inside the dome **is** grieffable (you can break the chests, blocks, fire, place blocks, etc.)  

__________________________________________________________
**How, where and when**  
The arena is located in Sky Utopia (9300, 6000), at the end of the city, you will see a glass dome.  
The players will have 1:30 (90 seconds) to gear up without PVP, (collect wood, mine, craft, build, destroy, etc.). In that time of grace period it's against the rules to hit the other players.  
After the 90 seconds, cool PVP begins, and will last until the last standing man wins.  
_______________________________________________________
**Prizes**  
The 1st place will win 5 diamonds and 5 obsidians for every player that played the hunger games, 256 blaze rods and 1152 wheat.  
The 2nd place will win 5 iron for every player, and 1152 wheat.  
The 3rd place will win 3d (or 6 iron).  
The last place will win 27 poisonous potatoes!.  

  
The minimal quantity of players to begin the hunger games is 5.  
If less than 5 players apply and actually go to the dome, there will be no HG.  
________________________________________________________
**Kits**  
 
There will be 4 kits:  
*Default (free): full iron armor without enchantments, no food, no items.  
*Bob the builder (3d): same as default but with 7 dirt blocks (actually useful).  
*Robin Hood (5d): same as default, with 1 arch (no enchantments, no arrows, there are arrows in the chests).  
*Axe man(3d): same as default, with 1 wooden axe.  
*Tank(5d): same as default with diamond chestplate
  
  
*You have to bring your kit items.*

__________________________________________________________
**Tips**
There are about 8 chests, most of them are hidden, you will have to break netherrack, (or dirt, or stone or anything) to open them.  
  
If someone is using something items not allowed by a kit (i.e. diamond boots) they probably found it looting in a chest.  
  
Break wood, wood is the key (to craft swords and things).  
  
Make anti-fire potions (ingredients in chests), you willl need them.

Yes, it is small but that is a cool feature because everyone will try to work in a little space, there will be almost no place to hide, the observers will be able to see everything, and the race for the chests will be brutal.

A couple things I would like to say. I'll be doing this as a monthly thing from now on to keep a record of the population and active towns. I'll try to improve it so if you have any suggestions let me know, if there are certain statistics not listed that you are interested in let me know. If you think there is incorrect data on this Census then you didn't have your towns members full participate. Omnitopia caught me while I was in the teamspeak and asked if they could fill it out for some of their members who don't use reddit, I allowed it. That will not be allowed next time though. Each person must fill out their own form. If you want accurate results please have your citizens fill out the form. Once each results are posted I will not go back and edit the data to include those who were late. Next time I will also be taking minecraft usernames instead of reddit usernames.

I also received a few amusing responses. If I thought your entry was a joke I deleted it from the form. So if Swagcity is a real place, I apologize.

I knocked up a quick coord display on the [map](http://teajizzle.eu/CivEx/map/).

I ran out of time to work on it, so it goes a little funky when you go out of the map boundary, I'll sort that next time.

Also, I'm going to add city and other point of interests to it, but I don't really want to maintain that myself (plus I don't know where anything is).

I'm going to add a simple text config file that'll hold all the coordinates, names and descriptions of these places.

The markers will have a popup when clicked that looks like clicking on a city in the real google maps, which will contain a brief summary of the location and links to town's subreddits/threads/wiki/whatever.

I would like volunteers that will be given access to a online text editor to maintain this config. It'll be really simple, you just need to have a good knowledge of the CivEx map and be able to write short, coherent descriptions.

Also, the next update will remove the blended in background colour so you can see the world border more clearly, and add another zoom level. If anyone has other requests then post away.

Then come join us in our new army branch! when you join this branch, you will be provided with nothing but the best in armor and weapons, to truly let your pvp abilities blossom!

What does it mean to be in the army branch of moria?

 Well, let me tell ya with fancy bullet points!

* You will of course be a Morian citizen and allowed every right a normal one has, but, you have the wonderful obligation to the military! If a 'Emergency Order' is to come out, say we have to burn down a settlement, then you must quickly drop your things and group into the proper meeting place. 

What if there's no wars to be currently fought, what will we do?

* Good question! You can act as a normal citizen would, build, farm, explore, etc.. But with routinely missions. Such as building walls or outposts in Moria, or gathering materials needed to build better weapons! If the routinely mission is done for the week, then you're on 'leave', which means you can do as you please for a timely matter until another routinely order comes in, the 'leave' however can be revoked if there is a 'Emergency Order' given. (Don't worry, this will more than likely be rare to happen) 

Is there a commander/leader of this branch? 

* Yes, the one who will activate this branch for actual war duty is Bouer, the king, he is also to be talked to before any military stations, buildings, and checkpoints are to be set-up. While I am your branch commander, I will be the one who will organize the routinely missions and gather you if there is any raiding parties/a law is being broken and needs to be enforced. 

Will there be a central base for the military branch? Or do we work in Understone? 

* There is a central base for the military yes, this facility is called 'Blizzard Post' not a original name but it works. The cords to the base is to be only discussed with other military branch members and other ranking seats in the government. 

Do we have to solely work in Blizzard Post? 

*  Nope! While I would like for you to work on a few projects in Blizzard Post before anything else, you are more than free to work in Understone or any other location in Moria. Though having the military branch members put their beds in Blizzard Post is required. (Void if you start a town or leave military service)


Well, if there's any other questions or you want to join, you can PM me here or in-game (GetNGoing).

While PVP was at the top of most people's 'Most Hated Aspect' lists, FactoryMod was another that scored relatively highly.

Ok, first off, put your torches and pitchforks down. I personally like FactoryMod because it adds a new element to gameplay that is new and intriguing to me (omitting similar style FTB contraptions), but I'm not here to advocate a full implementation of the plugin in its current state, or even completely at all.

While there's a few factories that I think would be great to have around ^^^^^^^^^(sweetjesuspleaseIneedastonesmelter) one in particular stands out: the printing press.

Printing presses add a unique element to the *other* server, albeit one which is often overlooked. With a press you can easily print money, issue government documents, spread propaganda, or publish your shiny new CivEx erotic fanfic with the greatest of ease! Given the emphasis on ideas/conflict resolution and not PvP that this server has, printing presses could potentially see an increase in usage rather than a semi-forgotten feature in the face of CoolPvP. Some degree of balancing would have to be done, of course, but that's all up for debate as to values and such.

What do you guys think? I don't call the shots, so these are obviously just ideas to throw around. But personally I think it'd be a great idea.",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,1539,24,Suggestion,bug

I posted this in another thread, but figured it couldn't hurt to make a little more public. I've rented a small test server that we can use to test some new plugins before introducing them to the server (I do a lot of testing before introducing anything, but the more people that are trying to break the plugin, the better). It doesn't have all of the plugins of the current map (I'm unsure if I can get a MySQL server running on this thing, TBD), but it has most of them. 
  
**Server address: civilex-test.mcph.co**  
  
EDIT: If people are having trouble with this address, try connecting to it with the IP: 198.24.175.66:58817 
  
Right now the big plugin I need tested is the DragonAttack plugin. That can be done by doing the following:  
  
* When you log onto the server, do '/kit diamond' to get unenchanted diamond gear, bow, arrows and steaks.
* When you're ready to fight the dragons, do '/summondragonattack'. This will spawn a new dragon on the map. Once a dragon is killed, it will drop its XP and one custom item (custom armor, swords, bows) and spawn a new dragon of a different type. Currently there are Ender, Elder, Fire, Lightning and Plague dragons, each with their own special attributes and abilities.
* When you're done fighting dragons and want the attack to stop, do '/summondragonkill'. This will remove all existing dragons from the server and will stop the next dragon from spawning.  
  
As you play, try to keep track of how many arrows you need to kill each dragon, how many steaks you need to consume, etc, and let me know the results. If you notice any issues, or have any neat ideas you think would be cool to see in the plugin, let me know. :)

&amp;nbsp;

You may know me as the leader of Omnitopia and the one who originally mapped the entire world of CivilEx in the first weeks of the server. This same data has since served as the basis for the rather convoluted and outdated claims map we currently have as well as the two different Webmap engines that allow for browsing the entire world.

&amp;nbsp;

Since /u/MrKireko was originally kind enough to trace everyone's claims in the low resolution version I had released initially, and since webmaps became a thing, I never bothered to release the full HQ map of the world as a single image file.

&amp;nbsp;

Since then we have had a large influx of new members as several new nations were created, and many have since been abandoned, relinquished or altered their claims.

&amp;nbsp;

As such I am considering releasing an up to date, HQ version of the claims map (about 12 Megapixels), including:

&amp;nbsp;

- A visible representation of everyone's claims drawn precisely to their specifications, with metric precision.

- The full size in m² of each nation's claims.

- The location of major settlements and the capitals of each nation.

- The list of resources available in each claim (if the governments are willing to disclose this).
- The openness of each government, how tolerable they are to unauthorized visitors or trespassers, and any specific penalties relevant to each claim.


&amp;nbsp;

The map will also feature:

&amp;nbsp;

- Biome overlays with the list of available mineral resources as well as the RealisticBiomes animal and crop rates.
- A grid overlay every 500 blocks which allows for locating coordinates visually.
- The distances between the capitals of nations and major settlements.
- Railway and road overlays between points of interest.
- Anything else you guys can think of that might be useful and I may not have included.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

For this purpose, all I'm asking is for everyone to post the exact specifications of their claims as well any of the aforementioned relevant information regarding their nation they wish to be included.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus, if your nation is currently active, with well defined claims and you would like to have it listed on the map, please post the (X,Z) coordinates of every point in your borders, forming the polygon that will represent your claim. If your claim has a specific common geometric shape, you can also specify the center point and the shape instead.

&amp;nbsp;

Nations which fail to list their claims within one week, starting tonight, will not be included until the next month, when I will be considering updates to the map.

&amp;nbsp;

Initially the map will be released as one or multiple high resolution image files. If anyone has an interest to convert it to web interface, let me know by PM.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, and this one goes to /u/Mbach231 if you could please consider giving everyone permissions to make WorldEdit selections (but obviously not perform any actual operations with them) this would make it infinitely easier for people to [have a visual representation of their own borders ingame](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1292886-worldeditcui), and thus forward me the relevant information to add them.

&amp;nbsp;

That will be all, thank you.",5,CivilizatonExperiment,,3333,22,Announcement,announcement

23.07 - Both parties agree that Nerd-chops' death was the catalyst for this war. Rev State invade due to this action, the invasion incured with the goal of 'make an impact on OH, destroy the beds and free up the island for people to access spawners. Now Twitch accepts the island as OH home, but the claims are the initial cause of hostilities, but Nerd chops murder was the cause for the war.

23.08 - Both parties agree the reason for the war, and the intention of the war do not align. Savvy acknowledges Nerd's murder, as murder. (Pause here, Twitch has disconnected)

23.11 - Twitch reconnects, talks continue. Twitch agrees that the murder of Chops was an excuse for an underlying intent of war.

23.12 - Terms of Peace commence. - Twitch requests both nations avoid each other as much as is reasonable, and requests server wide open access to the spawners.

Savvy draws on Pimpshrimps peace terms post, agrees that it is a good basis for drafting a deal from. Savvy is open to opening up the packed ice as a free resource. Apologises for giving the impression that they wanted to monopolise this resource. 
Brief explaination of reasons they chose the island as a home, the reason being they wanted to stay out of the way. They were evicted originally from Northwest republic location, and then felt like they were being forced out again, so some members felt defensive. Moreso after the threats of force from Amani, Arcis and Rev State. He feels these threats forced them to defend their claim, and regrets the aggressive and defensive mindset from OH at this time. 

Savvy accepts the murder of Nerd should never have happened, but he thinks that Nerd chops actions were foolish, Twitchington agrees with this sentiment. 

23.17 - Kahuzira speaking - They recieved sources of a large troop movement moving to the north, consisting of Elementz and Falquador and others moving into the OH territory, after those players already killing and griefing that same day. They recieved threats less than an hour after those first attacks, from Amani and Arcis. These players were in local chat range, threatening to 'take' the ice. OH members mobilized to defend themselves when they were told a Rev State member was assisting them, then snitches picked up Nerd chops. They found him wearing enchanted leather armour, (he was later found with TNT and harming potions and pearls) Kahu attacks Nerd. He felt the threatening actions and language of the force was threatening. In retrospect he accepts he overreacted, the situation was tense and he had a lapse of judgement, but feels that protecting himself was justified.

23.21 - Nerd Chops speaking - Proclaims not to have gone north with Elementz and co, but was in the area to purchase patched ice for a personal project. He was polite in chat, and didn't act aggressively. He was then killed. When he asks why he was killed the only response was 'kek'. Says his armour was held for 'tresspass'.

23.23 - Question to nerd from Savvy ' given the atmosphere at the time between OH and the other nations, in retrospect do you think it was wise to appear at that time, or did your presence cause the issues' Nerd- I wasn't aware of the commotion at the time. When asked if he had diamonds on him at the time to buy ice, he responds 'no, he was only interested in buying ice, and was only there to enquire about a deal'.

When asked why he brought defensive armour, what made him think he needed it. Nerd - From the sub, and his own feelings he felt that there was a risk to his safety.

Sloth quotes from a post on this sub, where Nerd infact claims 'he was not aware of tensions at the time'. Contradicting his previous statement.

23.28 - Reps discussions. Twitch speaking - He does not want reps for the griefing on the town, as he feels the damage they took matched the damage OH taken. OH does not want reps either.

 Nerd chops feels that the items he took from another player after their death matches the items he lost, so doesn't want reps either.

Gorellex wants reps for raided chests, Akn says that speaking to other players that members of RS say the chests were already empty. Twitch - This is a different chest, lost items were building materials, time was the main issue for replacing these things. Gorellex feels the physical damages were uneven.

Twitch - Feels the burning of RS was fair retaliation for the attackers actions in OH territory.

23.34 - Nerd questioned about his trade intentions, questioned by Savvy about why he had no materials on him at the time that were suitable for trade, and why he didn't offer a trade on the subreddit when he 'knew there was tensions and the risk of war'.

23.35 - Savvy - OH's stance on the claims, doesn't agree that 'staying away' from each others nations is a bad idea, wishes that both nations can instead open up to each other. Twitch agrees that that is a good idea once these issues have blown over. Savvy - One idea, have Twitch as the RS leader come make a public visit, and one of the OH leaders make a similar visit to RS, in a public fashion and as a show of peace, and to show that niether party wants more fighting, and wants this issue put to rest. Savvy finds the terms in Shrimps post very agreeable as a basis.

23.38 - Gorellex - Is Zenithangel any part of OH, Savvy 'no, he is not'. Zenithangel is the player 'shadedjohn', and has been banned. Signs left in RS hinted at him being linked to OH, these are agreed to be false information. OH had no knowledge of Zenith's history.

23.40 - Points of the agreements - Packed ice - OH are very open for anyone to come in and help themselves to packed ice. They are definitely interested in trades too, if people would rather not travel all the way north. Their borders are open for anyone to mine this. 

Vanilla ores - Each of these ores are found elsewhere, there is no monopoly here, and being a large nation they are a large group and will use a lot of resources, they wish to keep these private, as it is reasonable for them to use.

Spawners - Wishes for an outside party to come make a count of known spawners. OH will maintain ownership of 50% of the counted spawners, and outside parties can be repsonsible for the usage and protection of the spawners. OH would like a comittee to direct this, and will assist chosen players by sending the committee the coords of found spawners. They also request that OH spawners are the ones nearer to their settlements, and the ones on lands likely to cause disputes.

Twitch agrees with all these points.

Savvy - One minor concession from Rs in return for these terms - The player known as NerdChops will not be allowed by RS or OH to collect packed ice from the island. If he wants it then he can trade for it or have another member collect it.

Savvy then alters this statement, after Nerds honesty earlier in the talk. And is willing to review Nerds access to the island after 1 week.

23.46 - If any member of OH is attacked while harvesting ice, or using spawners they reserve the right to ban that player from those lands, or imprison and pearl them. But will contact that players nation about that instance, and treat is as an individuals action, rather than an act comitted by a full nation.

Savvy puts forth one term for both parties - Both RS and OH, as a message to the community as a show of their commitment to peace and aversion to war, OH and RS should be the first two nations to commit to an international court and prison system. Twitch agrees to this, commending it as a good idea.

23.49 - Both parties agree on all terms put forward.

A google docs treaty will be written up, and available publicly.

Here are the things that we found out and our opinions on them. 

* Sharpness: With the absence of Protection we feel that having Sharpness is too strong. It just cuts through the armor far too quickly. We feel that removing Sharpness altogether would do a lot to help combat. 

* Fire Aspect: Fire Aspect didn't seem to effect combat a lot because of the Fire Resistance potion, but without the potion Fire is incredibly effective. 

* Regeneration Potion: xHippo feels that the Regen potion makes combat too tanky. I feel that it helps to even out Combat and allows for a certain level of Tankiness that is needed. 

* Harming Potions: Harming Potions are incredibly overpowered. If you land two consecutive Harming Pots then the person dies. I feel that this is incredibly broken and needs a fix. xHippo came up with the idea that to be able to use Harming pots that you had to be in Gold Armor/Leather Armor; kind of like a ""Mage"". 

I'm not trying to say that our opinions are right and they are the end all be all of combat. I made this to generate discussion about combat so that we, as a server, can help balance combat and make our playing experiences better.  ",11,CivilizatonExperiment,,1439,34,,

Although negotiations have been attemped over Reddit, aswell as through Teamspeak, they have all failed and turned into a blame game where no actual solution was formulated.

&amp;nbsp;

I will admit that (I think everyone is already aware of this) I killed one of their members and destroyed 6 beds to make a statement out of frustration with their claim. This was a poorly decision and I apologize for this. Although I took no gear from the guy I killed or looted any materials belonging to Outer Heaven, Arcis is willing to pay reparations for the damage / inconvenience done. 

&amp;nbsp;

With the recent attack of Revolution State (and their allies), I am starting to wonder what will be the next exponential step and I'd rather not find out, as I am a firm opposer of pointless griefing. It has also come to my attention that, although we've expressed our concerns several times, we've not made a concrete preposition with our claims to resolve this now escalating conflict.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, I can't speak for everyone and each nation has their own interest in the Island, but these are the main problems most nations have with Outer Heaven's claim:

&amp;nbsp;

- Their claim is the only spot where Packed Ice can be found. This is a new scenario, because no other nation has a claim in which they try to monopolize a unique material. 

- The claim of Outer Heaven is filled with abandoned mineshafts and monster spawners. Now, although this is also the case for the Hell Island in the NW, the difference is that the Hell Island is -still- unclaimed, and the island is free to the public. 

- The island of Outer Heaven has vanilla ore generation. This means that any type of ore can be found, with the exception of emeralds (I think), while other nations are limited to the ore generation of their biome. For example, in the claim of Arcis we can only find Iron/Emeralds, so we have to travel for redstone/diamonds/gold.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Now that I have listed the issues , I'd like to propose a potential agreement. 

&amp;nbsp;

-**Packed Ice:** 

What we propose is that you let our nation aswell as the other nations on the server gather packed ice whenever anyone needs it. It's a resource that should be available to everyone. Of course, because of the strategic location of your base, you'll still be able to gather packed ice much easier and faster than the other nations, and I am sure the majority of the nations would have no problem paying a few diamonds per stack of packed ice. However, if a nation decides to spare their diamonds and collect the ice themselves, they should be allowed to and there should be no threat of getting killed (goes for both sides). One last note, I've now been to the Island twice and there's a ridiculous amount of ice, as in several DC's per player, so I don't think we have to worry about running out of packed ice any time soon. 

&amp;nbsp;

-**Vanilla Ore Generation:**

Our nation is willing to respect your vanilla ore generation borders and we will avoid mining in your claim to gather your resources. Although you're able to find any ore in your claim, we're willing to make this compromise in hopes of a succesful solution for the involved parties. It's a huge advantage being able to find any resource within your claim, while other nations have to travel thousands of blocks to find diamonds / gold. 

&amp;nbsp;

-**Monster Spawners:** 

This is a pretty crucial concern we have. Although you were the first to live on that Island aswell as the first to claim it, you have to understand that it's one of the two areas where spawners can be found and many nations were not aware of this. We're not trying to get 'a piece of the cake' or trying to get rich over the output of a spawner, we're simply trying to avoid a monopolization which would result in us paying the jackpot for simple monster drops. As for the monster spawners, I think it's nothing but reasonable to give ownership of 50% of the spawners to the other nations (will be a group that is responsible for constructing farms / protecting them), so they can be public spawners and available for each and everyone. This means Outer Heaven is able to make 50% of the spawners private property, which will get accepted. Leasing/buying spawners is a no-go, as it's exactly what we're trying to prevent; paying for something that should be public. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Course of action for the monster spawners:*

- Inventorize the amount and types of spawners on the Island.
- Other nations need to form a group that will be responsible (Already being discussed). 
- Formal trade agreement on the ownership of the spawners.
- Formed group is responsible for constructing / protecting their spawners.

&amp;nbsp; 

I honestly think this preposition is more than reasonable for both sides. Outer Heaven will keep a competitive advantage for the market of packed ice and monster spawners because of their strategic location, while the other nations on the server are allowed to gather packed ice and have access to public monster farms. The tremendous advantage of their vanilla ore generation aswell as their buildings/facilities will be respected and not trespassed. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

*TL;DR:*

- Other nations will be allowed to gather Packed Ice whenever they want.
- Outer Heaven's claim on the Vanilla Ore Generation will be respected and shall not be trespassed.
- 50% of the spawners will be private property of Outer Heaven, 50% will be given to a representative group, who will make public and protected monster farms.

Without the weird typing.


The universe works in a funny way. Once someone figures out, whether being them simply thinking about the real answer to the universe, as in 'why are we here' or 'how were we created', the universe will be instantaneously replaced by a cosmic entity of greater complexity.

This has happened before.

The universe is always in Progress or in Entropy.

Those who choose Progress can join the Consciousness.

No matter which universe mentioned before is in place, one entity will always exist. Progress. It is not a physical being. However, it is believed by the Conscious that Progress can be awoken: and those who awaken it will become godlike beings and gain all the knowledge they could ever imagine, even the answer to the universe itself.


However, we are imperfect beings. We are complex bags of meat that are still mysterious. So we turn to start to augment ourselves with metal until there is nothing organic left. And once there is nothing organic left, we are the perfect beings.

No matter what universe-like entity is in existence, there are always those who try to figure out the meaning to the universe, turn themselves into perfect metal beings, and awaken Progress itself. Those people are on a lonely planet in the universe, on a lonely island of Civ Ex.


Oh, the Consciousness origin story?

Diplomacy, trade, war, all interesting aspects of civilization would develop, creating a fun semi-experiment experience.

However, over the past week, a sort of culture has developed. Let's call this dramallama culture, maybe CoolPvP culture, or maybe even Civcraft culture. All issues are solved with a player whining on the subreddit, a few players whining in response, and then a bounty is placed where someone is pearled.

Now, this isn't quite the 'war and diplomacy' that we originally envisioned. I thought the towns might frantically send an envoy to settle things, and if things went wrong, they might march over and kill some people.

What I'm proposing is to turn PvP from a factions-like internationally-involved pearlfest to a game of legitimate combat.

*****

Here are my ideas, which can be implemented alone or together:

**Ban offline raiding.**

Simple enough, there must be someone around to guard when you decide to attack an entity, be it a nation or hermit. The proposed rule would make it so that when you attack a group, roughly %50 of their players (or at least the PvP-inclined ones) must be online to join in the battle. This would make all grief a challenge, and not just due to Citadel.

~~**Ban 'drama-ing'**~~

*The community has spoken.*

**Debuff Weaponry**

To help balance fighting, we should lower battle-based enchantments. This has already been done, but it's nice to reassert that this is important. Secondly, diamonds should be made a bit more rare. We've already reached the dreaded 'diamond armor is the norm', but it would be good to prevent too many diamonds from being handed out. I prepose that we give diamond ore only a %25 chance of spawning a diamond when it's broken, making diamonds (and enchants) more expensive. In addition, we should remove Fortune as it can supply am unreasonable amount of gems.

After getting a lot of feedback from people who've tried out the DragonAttack plugin, I think it's getting close to the point that I can put it on the server. Before I do that, however, I need coordinates to as many locations as possible.  
  
The way my plugin works (for now) is I can identify different clusters of players in order to determine an ideal dragon that should attack them. Then I can summon a dragon of whatever type is chosen near the cluster of players so the fighting can begin. Once a dragon is summoned, it will let out a loud roar that all players within 1km should be able to hear. There will also be a global message displayed identifying which city the dragon is near (""Dragon spotted near Greyshore"", ""Dragon spotted on the outskirts of Nexus"", etc). In order to provide the most accurate information on the dragons whereabouts (without providing actual coordinates), I need coordinates for as many places as possible.  
  
Please post the coordinates to your cities/nation below (I've been able to find a bunch by searching through the subreddit, but for accuracy-sake, I'd like for every city to post here). If you want me to add your city to the list but don't want to post the coordinates publicly, please PM them to me.  
  
Besides that, the plugin is basically ready for release. I haven't added all the dragon types or custom weapons I want to yet, but those can be added as we go along.

Now that that's out of the way, lets begin...
This all started when the feds built on our land and claimed it as their own. After a bit of fighting and negotiating, the following was agreed:
&gt;Angstrom's borders will remain untouched, with the exception of the gravel bay which has been sold to the federation for the price of 1 diamond block

&gt;The federation will remove all claims from Angstrom territory

Once this had been agreed, I began building a wall to show the exact border. This wall was built on the exact point of the original border, with the exception of the gravel bay being cut off from Angstrom. Everything should be fine now, right? WRONG! The feds apparently thought the border was too close, despite it being at the agreed location. They then had the audacity to demand more of our territory and decided to build their own ""border"" (a 2 block high wood fence that I chewed through in a minute with a stone axe) roughly 10 blocks into our territory.

I then went to negotiate. And by negotiate I mean tell them to stop their whining and to cut the drama because I was fed^^^^geddit? up with their games. They responded with threatening me with ""repercussions"" (They didn't specify)

Later that day, I decided to go negotiate again. They were still being as uncooperative as ever. These negotiations basically culminated in a stare down, at least until nerd_chops arrived. The feds continued being hostile, threatening us, insulting us and generally acting like 8 year olds. I will admit that I got quite angry at them at this point.

Since they had gone back on their part of the deal, and were being so hostile, we decided to go back on our side of the deal and annex them before they had a chance to attack us like they were threatening to do. Unfortunately, comrade chops splashed himself with a poison potion and ended up getting pearled, and I narrowly escaped. Chops told me that Twitchingtons would be on his way to help so I went to meet him, and then we did another attack against the feds. However, we were outnumbered and got defeated.

Now, federation, this has gone too far. If you release Chops immediately and return all items belonging to the Angstrom Dynasty and Revolution State, and also agree that the wall is the border, then there will be no war. However, if you do not comply, then the Angstrom Dynasty (and presumably the Revolution State too) will have no choice but to declare war upon the Federation.

Sincerely, DeathByError, Emperor of the Angstrom Dynasty

What I find ridiculous in the first place is that they bought land from us yesterday, and then they want more for what they payed for so-to-speak.

**Exhibit A**

[Here](http://gyazo.com/2b7a913a770c8ebdcc3de8c7080f5245) We can see that The Federation was ready to attack Angstrom at any given time. As I saw that, I went to angstrom. I would've stayed out of this big mess, but I will not tolerate this.
___________________________________________________________
**Exhibit B**

The Federation was being *extremely* hostile to passer-byers. As seen [here](http://gyazo.com/5be08530c7fbe82494bf7181a98c3559) poor old PenguinJ0e happened to be near their claim, in which they told him to ""back the fuck off""  
Now I don't know about you, but that sounds hostile to me.

___________________________________________________________

**Exhibit C**

The Federation seemed ready for this whole ""attack"" so I don't see why they are acting like the victim, when they caused this shitspree by infringing our claims. [Here](http://gyazo.com/0bff7e215a79e461d42f8f5dcb041a71) you can see that they had the advantage, and were ready to attack. They are no victim, they are a bully.

**Exhibit D(My Personal Favorite)**

It seems The Federation has attacked Rev-State after all.
[Right here](http://gyazo.com/c53b40f490095e6e11f1528b3ded7637)
   a Federation member claims to have burnt Rev-State down. If me attacking The Fed's means 'Rev-State has declared war on The Federation' then this surely means The feds attacked us first.

Once arriving, Death told me we needed to Annex them, so we hopped over what I like to call ""the bullshit border"" and proceeded to attack them. We had every right to, as they were infringing Angstroms land claims, which were discussed yesterday.

Last night I saw the base of a large wall/castle that was reinforced with stone placed near the Federation/Angstrom border, but on the Federation side. I decided to go to the actual border and place a wooden palisade of our own, on which I wrote that this was the actual border. This afternoon I logged in to see their giant wall *in sight of our capitol.* On further inspection I noticed that my wall had been removed, as well as signs saying that this was the true border, and that their wall ""is bigger than yours [mine]."" I was obviously infuriated. 

For reference, [this](http://i.imgur.com/eLe1eC9.jpg) is the agreed upon border (We are the blue claim south of Angstrom). Several representatives from Angstrom (Joesiv, DeathByError, one other I believe) we're there for the agreement, as well as some representives from Rev State, and I believe AKN was there as well.

As clearly shown by the map, our border extends all the way up to riverbank until the edge of the jungle. [Here is evidence of infringements upon our sovereign land by Angstrom.](http://imgur.com/a/wD7Ej)

After noticing this, DeathByError logged on. I explained to him that this was unacceptable, obviously on our claim, and that he must move it. I was met with ""Are you going to make a big deal out of this?"", and ""No, I will not remove it."" As well as ""Oh well you won't be using that land anyways."" I reminded him that his pearl along with many of our diamonds were traded in return for the land he is building this giant wall on.


Also, the wall is not only on our claim, but is within sight of our capitol, while it is 600 blocks or so from Angstrom's capitol.

**Angstrom must do the following:**

*We demand that Angstrom removes this wall and pays us in return for this offense.

*If Angstrom does not remove this wall we will remove it ourselves and seek extra compensation for their crimes.

*If Angstrom fails to provide us compensation for their, we will conduct border raids on their territory. We aren't savages, contrary to popular belief. Border raids include killing but not pearling or griefing.

Currently a Diamond reinforcement takes 256 breaks.

On obsidian With an unenchanted Diamond pick thats 40 minutes, with an E5 its only 10.88 minutes. 

This means a 50 layer vault, requiring over 75 Thousand diamonds and obsidian blocks to create, takes just over 33 hours to break with an unenchanted pick, and with an E5 this is little over 9 hours.

The litteral months on end of hard work and dedication required to make that, takes 9 hours to squander

As I see it only two options are avaliable, nerf enchantments, which IMO is a bad idea, or Buff citadel.

Yes coming here to grief and kill is against the rules, so why would we need large vaults to permapearl? Because if you use them to store chests of wealth then why should you lose everything you own, that won't be returned to you unless you go through all the work to do it again, to someone who's only been here 2 days gearing up to do that, and doesn't care about a ban.",3,CivilizatonExperiment,,1001,33,,

On one hand it serves as an effective way of putting out news and information, and providing a place for discussion. The problem is that the way we currently do these things undermine both the social experiment aspect of the server and perhaps deprive us of fun in the game.

The way the server is intentionally set up provides an element of isolation between civs. In-game, a civ on the north side of the map won't know what a civ on the south side of the map is doing unless directly informed. This is a good thing. It allows different civs to develop in their own ways and overall create a diverse series of communities across the map.

The issue is that the way we currently use the subreddit destroys this isolation entirely. Whenever anything happens, people immediatly post it on the subreddit. News, bounties, and trades are all fairly instantaneous common knowledge. Due to this, rather than having a server made up of many different communities we have a server community living in many different areas. 

Examples of this can be seen in the Outer Heaven fiasco where subreddit posts served as a cataclysm for a multi-nation force attacking a small, relatively unknown, uncared about group living on a snowy island in the north. Would those events have turned out different if those players had to both share their issue and raise their force purely in-game? Another example is today's territory dispute between Angstrom and the Federation. What started out as an internal issue for Angstrom ended up being posted on the subreddit and turned into an international affair with other groups even getting involved.

The same issue extends to bounties and trades. While it is extremely useful and efficient to post them for everyone to immediately know, it undermines the game. What kind of trade networks might develop when players have to figure out whats for sale and wanted only in-game? How will our perceptions of pvp and sovereignty change when bounties aren't instant common knowledge?

I believe my point is clear. The way we currently use the subreddit completely alters the way we play on the server and hinders civ gameplay. However, the subreddit it by no means a bad thing and these are some suggestions to use it properly:

1. Do not post trades and bounties to server subreddits. These the main /r/CivilizatonExperiment  and others like /r/CivilExchange. Alternatively, try to find ways to spread the word in-game and see what kind of new networks develop. If you absolutely have to post things online, do so on local subreddits. For example, Greyshore trades and bounties would go on Greyshore's subreddit.

2. Do not post about or discuss ongoing events and conflicts. This is the subreddit's biggest issue. By doing so you are absolutely altering their outcomes. Play the game on the server, not the subreddit.

3. Do discuss events and conflicts after they've happened. While the worst thing you can do is talk about them while they're happening, the best you can do is discuss them after they're over. People want to know about these things, and discussing them from a reflective perspective will provide better analysis and understanding than ever possible while they're ongoing.

Remember; play the server, not the subreddit!",0,CivilizatonExperiment,,3426,23,Meta,meta

All of you have noticed a recent influx of new cities, which is nice as it shows the server is growing. Granted, I would like to reiterate from previous discussions on the matter that I am not opposed to the creation of new cities. 

However, how many of these cities are one province minors? How many of them are making large land claims they (probably) cannot uphold? How many go inactive within the month? How many of them have just started and not even understand what a single plugin does?

The creation of these cities and continuing land-grabs and claim wars have only antagonized one another, and on more than one occasion, started a violent conflict. The fact these conflicts arise is not a bad thing, as it is a part of the game, but to be started over a couple people claiming too much contested land? Seems unnecessary.

I will not propose or directly ask of anything of anyone, but I do suggest that maybe a standard should be set within the community to determine when a settlement is considered a country or not. This is not to bully the newbies into submission of an already established state, but to know that the people establishing said new country are determined to stay and grow, and if they are not up to it, join an already established nation (people do not seem to realize maintaining societies and nations is quite a difficult task.)

Main points I would like for you to notice:

- Standards should be established to prevent the creation of short-lived nations.

- Standards should be established to prevent unnecessary conflict.

- Standards should be established so a single player cannot large claims with the excuse of sovereignty.

- Standards should be established so that cities already established may grow larger and prosper, achieving great things that a dozen smaller independent cities could not.

As mentioned before, I will not directly ask of anything since I believe this issue lies on the hands of the community. Please discuss about your opinions on the matter and whether standards should be introduced to decrease the amount of unnecessary cities.

And to end on that note, I would like for all to know that I plan to dissolve Elbeck, as I am a single person state. I am considering to join Nexus, shrink my claims to my immediate area, and use my current build as a colonial settlement under Nexus.

163333314,2p8ssi,1418541001,1,0,Dydomite,Land claims for Sanctuary,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2p8ssi/land_claims_for_sanctuary/,"Hello, I am dydomite. For the past few weeks or so me and some friends of mine have been working on a charity project for new players. When we first joined we noticed we all spawned in the exact same place, and there was a small base thing nearby courtesy of Jackson of Nexus. We decided to squat it and develop more facilities for it so others can have a better start than we did. We've redecorated and have been working on projects to help newcomes settle into the server, i.e. lighting up the beach, publicly reinforced essential items like beds/crops, etc. We basically wanted it to be a place anybody can get on their feet, whether that means just getting food and wood for the voyage to a nearby town, or getting numerous ores and enchanted tools to go start your own efficiently. 


I didn't want to have to do one of these 'land claim' things for a few reasons. First, because I think they're somewhat ridiculous and that the community taking them as seriously as it does will only create problems. I hoped to show that formalized land claims weren't necessary by making this place an area of repute despite it having no borders on a map. However, I don't think swimming against the current will do any good now. It seems to me land claims are necessary for any sense of political legitimacy regardless of whether actual development has occured. Secondly, Sanctuary was fairly covert. Most of it is underground and the above ground developments don't look like anything significant so this has helped us minimize crime/grief despite being where everybody starts. Keeping it off of maps helped maintain this advantage but recent events have meant we can't keep it secret without invalidating our claim on it. 

-----------------------------------------------------

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/wgYCItC.png) are the claims for this charity project, codenamed ""Santuary"" for now. The circle is where the main build is and the line is a future canal project to connect the southern river systems to the eastern bay. We don't care if you want to build here, just stay 5 blocks away or so from our builds and we'll be fine. However, it is our land, and as such it is run by our rules. We won't be having any fancy shmancy statist government, just basic human decency kind of rules. I just don't want punks killing people in Sanctuary under the excuse that it's within their borders - Sanctuary is to be kept apolitical. If someone's hiding out there that gerfer your town then whatever but if Nerd Chops is in sanctuary asking to buy ice, you can't pearl/kill him under the justification that he's trespassing on your land.

---------------------------------------------------


This brings me to one of CivEx's latest land claim threads. People calling themselves 'The Federation' have claimed not only our area - despite it being developed - but also a majority of the jungle around the river splinter pictured. I can understand how they might not have known about this, so I'm not holding it against them. However, we do retain a stronger claim over the areas of land shown and as such we don't recognize their claims within the specified areas. Outside of that we don't really mind for now. 


I hope the Federation can listen to reason so we don't have to live through another land claim drama. We're quiet neighbours and we aren't looking to be a sovereign state. The idea is that sanctuary can have nobody living in it at all and yet still serve it's purpose when some new player joins. Once this is finished the idea is to move on to another project and get volunteers from the international community - codenamed ""Groundskeepers"" - to simply stop by and access repair materials in a hidden groundskeeper-cache to touch up whatever grief will naturally occur over time. It will have no presence, no goals of expansion, and no political agenda of it's own. It's no threat to you, it's just a building with signs in it explaining what to do/where to go/how the server works. There's more than enough land in the area for the both of us, and we're already fine with you having the lion's share. I hope that with this The Federation will give up it's claims over those particular stretches of land and that other nations/individuals comment to say whether they recognize our claims as valid despite them not being made public first.

I came too late. When I heard about this server, a spark ignited, I saw so many possibilities. One of them, was being ""that guy"", mainly like xriptidex, from civcraft. Maybe that seems silly to you - but on my time there, riptide was the dude. Total badass in my book. Fight going on? He was there. Someone unjustly griefed? He was on the griefers tail. I guess what I'm trying to say is, Mkcoates is right. I'm just some asshole who wanted to be somebody, and I became somebody, but not that somebody I wanted to be. I became an arrogant asshole who only looked for ways to ""be a hero"" but those ways did the opposite. I was on the wrong side, I should've been more on the political justice side, like AMB. Instead, I chose the physical justice side, or at least I thought that's what justice meant.

Just a couple reminders on the new plugins. I've added a bunch of new custom enchantments. These enchantments cannot be made on an enchanting table, nor can any item with a custom enchantment be used on an anvil (which means there's only one way to get items with custom enchantments). The only exception to this rule is Alchemical Protection, this enchantment should function exactly like a vanilla plugin. As always, please let me know if you notice any issues with the plugins. I've had to make some...interesting adjustments to the EnchantmentAPI in order to get this to work the way I wanted it to (people who use an enchanting table will notice something strange happening; this was unexpected, but I decided not to try and fix it cause it looks neat).

So let's get started with some basic stuff. Twitchingtons is taking a break, tired of all the random shit that's been happening. He predicts that Rev State will be griefed a lot in the coming days and doesn't really want to deal with it. He's probably right, but we'll try our best to avoid that, I suppose.

Anyway, in his stead I have been left in temporary command of RS. I have some ideas I was planning on doing anyway as a private citizen but assuming I can secure peace I will be going ahead and implementing them officially. More on that at another time, though, it's not really relevant for this particular topic. My main focus is going to be sorting out a diplomatic solution that will turn a tenuous pseudo-peace into a lasting one. 

Now then, let's talk about NerdChops. What he's done is **completely unacceptable**. I'm more than a little disappointed that a guy who was usually pretty chill and fun on Civcraft has gone and done what he has on this server. His first actions were out of line but I could see the cause -- too much passion resulting from a desire to protect his friends. However, this most recent action of griefing the Feds is completely, totally unacceptable. 

Rev State was in NO WAY officially supporting this action. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/oxwplqq.png) proof of Twitchingtons clearly showing displeasure towards what NerdChops had done so that everyone can see this was not some sort of state-sponsored terrorist act (this is the first part of the PM where he told me he was making me temporary leader). Furthermore, everything following the treaty regarding the Angstrom border, including Prynok's bounty hunting, was in no way connected with the government of our state. We had hoped that NerdChops would learn his lesson after being vaulted for three days, but clearly that is not the case. I would remind the international community that the *only* two people who acted against the Federation at that time were a) Prynok in his attempt to collect a bounty and b) NerdChops in this most recent action. 

I know that people will attempt to say that we, as a state, need to take responsibility for these actions. However, a government in real life is not held responsible for crimes committed by its citizens in foreign countries. So it is on here. We did not support either action. We only acted as a mediator for Prynok, still expecting him to be punished, and after I had heard about what Nerd did from Twitch I was planning on completely dropping all RS support from him, but that wasn't really an issue by the time I got home (which was just now so that I could write this post) since he posted that video and got pearled and all.

In short; **we will not be taking responsibility for the private actions of Prynok or NerdChops.** The only people aiding and abetting them have come from other states. Attempts to continue bringing up the previous actions regarding the contention over Angstrom's border are irrelevant, there has been a treaty made and to the best of my knowledge all terms have been fulfilled, assuming the person I delegated to pay the 30 diamonds has done so (I haven't been able to get on, I tried to bring them the diamonds on I believe Wednesday but lagged so hard I managed to get blown up by about four creepers before I was even able to respond to their presence). If he hasn't, I will get on that ASAP.

Now, onto my last topic, which is neutrality. **Rev State will, effective immediately, be declaring international neutrality for an indefinite period.** We will attempt to tie up all loose ends with the Federation. We will be resuming diplomatic activity as soon as I (or Twitch, if he has returned at the point) feel that our state has had time to restructure and better deal with situations like have come about in this conflict, where leadership is unable to adequately respond to a situation before someone does something that inevitably ends up getting blamed on the state as a whole.

As to the WA, I'm still planning on attending any meetings and representing our interests, but for the duration of the period of neutrality we will only be representing our own interests and will not be taking the side of one state against the other based on diplomatic relations.

I'm hoping once everything has normalized and we've prepared to some degree, I can begin plans that have less to do with drama and more to do with the future of our state in harmony with others in the international community.

The durability on it is only a little better then leather. I can't tell you how many time I've been mining in nether and expose a single source of lava, that kills me. Not to mention just now, I was leaving the hell biome and while I was running to the shoreline, I get thrown into a lava pit due to heat exhaustion. Fortunately I was carrying a water bucket on me, but that wasn't enough because of the fact I was heat exhausted. I could move and so ghast hit me dropping down 3 blocks, only to have more lava pour onto me.

Its main feature is that it lets you link minecarts to form a train. This would make powered rails less of a necessity for a functional rail system - just hook up a furnace cart to the *front* of the train and boom, you're on your way to trade relations.
The plugin can also add automated train stations that will lock the carts so they don't roll away without you, another very useful feature.
While the plugin does stray away from the vanilla experience in other aspects, such as the train pathfinding, I think just the ability to link carts would be amazing, and the easy stations would be the icing on top. Plus, it doesn't add any new blocks or recipes to the game.

Here are all conflicts that the Federation has been involved with, in chronological order.

On the first day after we had built our base, we went to mark it on the map. Unfortunately part of our claim overlapped with theirs. We just colored over it as we hadn't seen any angstrom members before.

Angstrom got mad at us on the subreddit. One angstrom member came over here to get rid of us. After we told him we would not leave he attacked us. We ended up pearling him. 

We then had a talk with angstrom representatives in front of rev state and nexus members. We ended up buying the land we wanted from angstrom.

That night I see the base of a reinforced structure built on our claim. I proceeded to build a wooden palisade on the border so that angstrom would know where it was.

The next day I see that the wall I built was destroyed, and the wall inside our claim was fully built, and gigantic, complete with a sign that said ""mine is bigger than hours"". When I saw death by error, I asked him why is this built on our land, and told him to remove it. He curtly said no, and told me that is the actual border, which it isn't, according to the map we both agreed on.

We chased death by error away from the wall, and stood in front of it to prevent him from coming into our land.

Nerd chops from rev state comes down to help dbe, saying ""I came here to eat steak and pearl moterfuckers, and I already ate my steak."" They then approached us. After some taunting back and forth they burned down the tree that marked the border, then crossed the border and chased as back to our base.

They climbed the wall and shot at us during our retreat. After another standoff and some shots fired back and forth, they chased us into our base. They proceeded to break down our door and attack us inside. We fully committed at that point and tried to kill them. We chased them back, pearling nerd chops in the process.

A group from rev state and riviera come down to free nerd chops. The whole group is slain but we ran out of pearls.

The next day we have a discussion with angstrom in front of 15 other people to discuss the peace terms, where the border really is, and what reps they will pay us. There is a map elsewhere on the subreddit with all current and previous border locations. We agree to move nerds pearl to nexus, where he will be released 3 days from when he was pearled, and agreed not to fight us anymore so he doesn't cause more drama.

Two days later a Morian try's to run the border, and we escort him out if our claim. We stay up to 80 blocks outside our claim as we follow him so he doesn't come into our land. We dig a moat around him as he goes afk. He then starts stopping every few seconds in order to make our job more complicated. We punch him to get him moving, he punches back. We punch back, he throws a weakness potion at us, jumps in the river, and shoots us with his flame bow. We shoot him down in the river and he is pearled.

He placed a 50d bounty on Darwinism and i, the two people who were his escorts. A raiding party comes into federation land to claim the bounty and attacks federation members. This party includes Prynok from rev state, who's town 2 days ago agreed to a peace deal and to not attack us. All four of the raiding party are slain without any federation deaths . I am working out the release of the five people currently pearled with their respective towns.

I don't really take parts in political conflicts that much, Arcestir likes to stay hidden from the rest of the world.

But this Federation shit? Our allies at Riviera, Angstrom, Rev. State, etc, are getting killed and I want this **to end**.

Let's settle this. I've got some ideas in my head.

First of all, to Federation:

STOP. You will cancel all bounties put on enemies caught in the controversy. You will release all pearled users caught in this controversy. You will take the toll off of the river, **YOU DO NOT CONTROL THE RIVER.** You will not act like a god or something that can control whatever you want. Federation can then continue in peace.

The consequences if you do not agree with this:

You've already made such a shitty name for yourselves. If you don't follow these, I just really don't give a shit about what happens to you at this point. You guys are being dickbags and such, and ignoring this will just push that name even more. Hell, if I have to, I will assists my allies in enforcing peace by helping them wipe you off the map.

To enemies of Federation:

If these conditions are met, you will STOP attacking Federation, and forget this has happened.

Consequences if you do not follow:

Chances of future trade with Arcestir will be low, and you will be seen as a warmonger.

All I want to end this shit. Peace or not, just to end this shit in the fastest, least bloodiest way. I really don't care for war or peace, Arcestir mainly wants to be kept alone but my allies are being hurt and I want Federation to stop without a huge world war.

Please.

**EDIT**:

I'm going to extend the terms of Federation.

Federation will no longer place any bounties on those in this controversy that have simply angered them.",14,CivilizatonExperiment,,1747,41,Discussion,discussion

Therefore I am placing a bounty on NerdChops for being a twat, and for causing drama after he agreed not to cause any more drama.

The bounty will be 64d and any of the pearls of one of the four guys we pearled earlier today. Even if you don't have any reasons to have these guys pearls, I'm sure their friends will pay handsomely for them.

I'm responsible for my actions at the federation, I'll admit I shouldn't have attacked. Did I want cool pvp? Ehh, I was in the mood for it. Plus, I wanted to protect my old town that I joined when I was new here.


**So, here's a run through.**

I lost some valuables in the battle. My UNBIII Diamond armor set, a SharpII KnockbackI diamond sword, and a bow that I honestly don't care to much about. (Hell, keep the bow!)

I wanted to be polite with Sharpcastle33, it's best to start off with good terms on a situation like this. [I asked for the location of my items](http://imgur.com/a/cCVBR) to which I was told they have them in their base, and I will not be receiving them. This infuriates me, but what infuriates me more?

I mean no harm, Sharp, but I want my items, I spent a good while working to get them, and if we stole your items, you'd do the exact same thing.

**What I'm Proposing**

To the Federation: You have **24 Hours** from when this post is made to dropchest my gear on the Angstrom - Federation boarder, or else, a large bounty will be made on behalf of your leader, Sharpcastle. My armor will be treated as Revolution State property, and will be dealt like so.

**Current Bounty from myself:** 200D for the pearl of Sharpcastle33.

Sharp, you already seem to have a bounty on your head, and the higher it goes, the more interested people become. I will not *personally* attack your nation in **ANY** physical way, but by god, I will retrieve my gear. 

You're digging your own grave, Sharpcastle33.

But The Lava God was a silent one, and The Fire God felt lonely in The Nether. So He decided to pull some of Life's creatures to The Nether. He took the Ghasts, large flying squid-like creatures, and gave them the ability to spit exploding fireballs known as Fire charges. The Ghasts turned white of horror and cried because of their fate, which they still do to this day. He took the Blazes, in that time known as the Chrysos : desert people with a golden skin, and gave them the ability to breathe fire. This destroyed their lungs, thus making it difficult for them to breathe, and turned most of their body into smoke. After this they existed out of a golden coloured head, smoke and flying golden limbs. He took the Ypsilós : tall people who lived in the jungle and savannah. Upon arrival, the Ypsilós' bodies melted and only their skeletons remained, covered in their black acidic  blood which made all life it touched wither, thus gaining the name Wither Skeletons. He took slimes, whom sticky slime glued to the lava, thus becoming Magma Cubes. Because The Fire God took a lot of slimes is one of the reasons that slimes are so rare. He took the Pigmen, an intelligent race of humanoid pigs and one of Life's best and favourite creations. The Pigmen, who could not bear their fate, killed themselves. The Fire God, however, did not want to lose them and begged The Lava God to revive them. The Lava God granted this wish and the Pigmen became zombies for all eternity. All creatures in The Nether envy the Humans because the Humans are allowed to live happy lives. So all Nether creatures are hostile towards humans except for the Pigmen, who feel close to the Humans. This all saddened Life deeply and made Sun furious like never before. Since then no plant can flourish in The Nether and the Sun will never shine.

There comes a time in every dwarven kingdom when the dwarves of the earth must rise up from their subterranean dwellings and find their place on the surface. As such, the Amani Kingdom has begun planning and efforts for the construction of a surface city. In order to meet the needs of our expanding nation, it has been decided after much internal discussion to expand our central claim.

Under the direction and blessing of King Falquador, the following changes will be made to Amani Kingdom's central claim:

Our claim shall extend from the southernmost point of Greyshore's claim where it connects with Amani's claim, and from the southern tip of Amani's claim east to the river, but not on the river itself. [This is a rough depiction of the extension.](http://i.imgur.com/T3Hlk1A.jpg)

This territory is unclaimed, does not impair travel or the activities of other nations, and serves a reasonable and immediate purpose. Even with the expansion, our total claims are still significantly less than that of other nations across the map.

Mbach has researched into options of fixing the DragonAttack plugin. The problem was that the dragon would always fly to 0,0 on the map, which basicly breaks the DragonAttack plugin. With the EnderDragonPlus plugin, we should be able to fix this, but it is not availabe for the server version we currently are running. What Mbach is planning on doing, is updating the server to Minecraft 1.7.10 so we can use EnderDragonPlus. To do this, we have to update all the plugins to 1.7.10 to make sure every plugin works properly. This also means we can have the best version of Citadel and PrisonPearl on our server. The update to 1.7.10 would require Mbach to upgrade RealWeather (and possibly other plugins) to 1.7.10. 

The update to the newer version might take some time, and Mbach will probably be mostly focussing on that, just so you people know. While we can't guarantee the update to 1.7.10 (Although it's very likely), we're trying our best to provide you guys with an updated server with the fixed DragonAttack plugin as soon as possible, maybe at the end of the weekend!

He had a [KOS post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2p77rz/kos_on_lafitteca_possibly_sharpcastle33_too/) made about him. After he was pearled he came in teamspeak asking about switching to a new account as his main because people wanted to pearl him on his Lafitteca account. I tried multiple times to explain to him that he can't use a second account. He was convinced that it wasn't a second account it was a ""different"" account and would not listen when I kept telling him that it's the same thing. 

Apparently he had already been using the happy_teddy account and continued using it after the conversation clarifying to him that alt accounts were not allowed. He then attacked daddo in Greyshore on the happy_teddy account and was [POS](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2pask3/attacked_in_gs_pos_on_happy_teddy/) for that one too. He also tried to get Daddo banned for drowning him with that situation. Yeah.

He had been in teamspeak two or three times, possibly more, asking about using a ""different"" account at this point and had been told each time that it was against the rules but decided to use the moonpopcorn account anyways. He says it's his sister's account but I've been told by multiple sources that it was him ""trying to trick"" the admins.

Basically, he used alts before AND after being told it wasn't allowed. Oh and he also told me in teamspeak that he'd just use a VPN to come back because ""on other servers it's okay to get around a ban by using a VPN and the admins let you"". Not here, sorry.

165804592,2qprn4,1419866181,1,0,mbach231,New Plugin Possibility - Diseases,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2qprn4/new_plugin_possibility_diseases/,"Hey all. Last week, Phaxar messaged me about the possibility of adding some sort of disease plugin to the server. Basically, some plugin that is capable of infecting players with different diseases that have different effects. We looked into the existing plugins and found that none of them were suitable for what we wanted, so I started working on a basic framework for a disease plugin (which I'm un-originally calling DiseaseCraft for the time being).  
  
Many core-features of the plugin are under-developed, but here's what I have so far. Diseases are fairly customize-able. Each disease has 5 different stages. Each stage has different transmission rates and can have unique effects. For example, let's say we have a simple disease called Zombie Plague. In the first stage, a player may get nauseous every five minutes for 15 seconds, and this lasts for 20 minutes. During this stage, the player is not contagious. During the 2nd stage, the player now begins feeling worse effects, like being Poisoned every 2 minutes for 5 seconds. The player now has a 15% chance of infecting any player within 5m of themselves. In the 3rd stage, the player might be effected by Wither once every minute for 2 seconds. They now have a transmission rate of 40% within a distance of 8m. This stage lasts for 15 minutes. For the final two stages, the disease gets progressively less harmful, and is not contagious at all.  
  
Now, diseases don't only need to do simple Potion Effects (like Hunger, Slow, Blindness, etc), we can customize it much more than that. For instance, we could have a disease where, if a player is standing in the sunlight, is set on fire for 10 seconds. However, if it's nighttime and the player is standing in a dark area, the player gets a slight health regen. Or we could have a disease where if a player is outside during a full moon, they get a lot of stat bonuses, but the day after the full moon and during a new moon, they have big stat penalties. Not saying these would be in any final release, just want to give an idea of how we can affect different players at different stages.  
  
Now, how to create cures. Surely there must be some way for players to rid themselves of diseases. Well, after a bit of work, I found a way to integrate DiseaseCraft with Brewery! We can add a variety of different recipes to Brewery so players can do in-game research to discover brews (cures) to diseases. Things like Antibiotics, Antidotes to specific diseases, or even Vaccinations can be found by doing research! We plan to have a single ""medicinal"" ingredient that will be common in all cures. After that, it's up to the players to discover the cures.  
  
Different cures can have different effects on certain stages of disease. For instance, let's say our Zombie Plague, in the first state, can be removed with any antibiotics. If it gets to the 2nd stage, however, taking a Basic Antibiotic will progress the disease to the next state, taking an Antibiotic will progress the diseases 2 states, and taking a Strong Antibiotic will completely remove the disease. In the 3rd state, Basic Antibiotics do nothing, Antibiotics advance the disease 1 stage, and Strong Antibiotics still completely removes the disease. Basically this means that if players can identify what disease they have as early as possible, there's a very good chance they can remove the disease without taking too much damage or infecting nearby players. Even if they don't have the best antibiotics available, if they have enough of the lesser versions, they could help the disease end sooner by taking a few antibiotics.  
  
Right now, because it's only the basic plugin, only players can be infected. However, I intend on expanding this out so other entities can also be infected and can infect other animals/people. This would mean farmers would need to keep an eye on their herd to see if any of their stock has been infected (will likely create some sort of item a player can use to check if an entity is infected with some disease). If it's possible, I would love to be able to add an infected-meat property, where a player has a chance of contracting a disease if they're eating meat that came from an infected animal (the chance is lessened if the meat is cooked).  
  
The biggest thing that I don't have developed yet is initial infections. While spreading diseases between entities is all well and good, there's still a question of, ""where the hell do these diseases originate?"" For some animal diseases, we may have a random chance of an animal becoming infected when it's spawned. For other diseases, maybe if a player is attacked by a certain mob (like Zombie Plague, could be contracted if a player is hit by a zombie), maybe it could be if a player is within a certain proximity of a mob in a certain biome or during a certain time of day. Initial infection is definitely one of the things that needs the most work.  
  
I'm sure I'm leaving some things out, but would people be interested in something like this being added to the server? Keep in mind that the plugin is still a WIP and will surely be tweaked before the final release, but I'd just like to gauge interest in whether or not people think this would be fun to have.",14,CivilizatonExperiment,,5232,79,,

166488628,2r4fg4,1420224065,1,0,taylorprice,My Two Cents on the Potential Server Decline,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2r4fg4/my_two_cents_on_the_potential_server_decline/,"Everybody has a point in past posts with the holidays being a large reason for the server decline, but there is definitely more to the decline in the server population. 

Let me blanket this by saying that I think this server has the potential to be so cool and special, which is why I continue to play on it whenever I can.

So why is there a decline in activity? Most people on this server are way too sensitive. This goes in many directions.

* Things get broken, stolen, misplaced, and/or altered. This doesn't mean you immediately get on the Reddit and tattle/bitch/moan. Nobody likes to play with whiners. Pretty simple. (I admit to complaining early on because my nation didn't understand snitches and Citadel).

* Making land claims is good and fine. Making large land claims? Sure whatever makes you happy. Throwing temper tantrums when people cross your borders/trying to act like a tough guy? No one likes that. Who cares if people come to your territory to mine. Realistic biomes make it necessary to go certain places to get materials. ""But why don't you just trade for what you need?"" Sure that is a good question, but when prices or unreasonable or when it is just as convenient to get it yourself it shouldn't be a big deal. I get that people are on edge ""protecting their turf"", but if someone enters your claim or begins mining, that doesn't make them an immediate threat.

* Some users (definitely not a large crowd) act WAY too entitled on this server and Reddit; whether it is because they know more about plug-ins/mods or because they belong to a larger nation. People don't want to keep playing if they don't feel welcome or aren't given a little aid in learning about plug-ins. 

&gt;Welcome to CivilizationExperiment, a social experiment in a Minecraft server, with as research question the following: ""How would you react if you were put in a custom survival world, where everyone is trying to make the world civilized?""

The point of this server is for people to get on and play Minecraft as if it were a blank world with the goal of civilized living amongst differing nations and cultures. All of the small riff raff really is holding back the potential of this super cool concept. I know that griefing sucks and some people come in and cause problems, but that doesn't mean we need to fill the Reddit with negativity and whining. Most people tend to adapt to their surroundings and are very impressionable when they don't have all of the answers. So instead of using Reddit to make a civilization and help others learn and grow, it appears most have resorted to using this tool to vent.

I don't want people to think I am pointing fingers or telling you what to do. I just want to give my opinion on why the server may be declining, and offer some suggestions for improving it!

We're planning to construct a fully self-sustainable, futuristic underground city, which is inspired by similar futuristic cities from various sci-fi games and films, like [Midgar, from Final Fantasy VII](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100731152801/finalfantasy2/de/images/8/82/Midgar_Edge.png), [Hengsha, from Deus Ex: Human Revolution](http://media.vogelius.se/2011/11/dxhr-2.jpg) or [Neo-Tokyo, from Akira](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/3695/530502-neotokyo.jpg).
We also want to make Tacitum inhabitable for other players, despite the rather prestige-centered design.
The following screenshots display the progress we've made so far, (with the help of two awesome new workers who joined us, ChronicPower and Ozymandias1337) for the sake of blatant self-promotion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept for Tacitum has changed, from [this](http://i.imgur.com/wSboEoT.png), to [this](http://i.imgur.com/l0E7Jwe.png) (the farms will probably resemble arcologies, and not be as flat as pictured). If everything goes right, it's probably going to relieve us of a bit of digging.

The first thing we did, was digging out the foundation for Tacitum, [right here](http://i.imgur.com/suMZwvK.jpg) ([brighter version here](http://i.imgur.com/giQ5VyF.jpg)), which took us a few days and was a major PITA. Fortunately, we have our kick-ass [beacon](http://i.imgur.com/KAGTRBz.jpg) with Haste II.

Next, we moved on to about y: 85, where we are currently digging down to bedrock to prepare the construction of the first buildings. [That's the circle](http://i.imgur.com/L1VpK3w.jpg). I rarely get past the experience level of 10, [because I keep falling down](http://imgur.com/Gi37JqH.jpg). This is the [view](http://i.imgur.com/bay4koy.jpg) from the top layer.
Here is a [shot](http://i.imgur.com/Xbuu1PZ.jpg) of a few of our storage chests, for the stone, and [these](http://i.imgur.com/TlGfnhs.jpg) are our enslaved zombie villagers gone civil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point we'd like to mention that we are still accepting full-time and part-time workers. You will be fed, geared and part of one of the biggest, if not **the** biggest project on Civ(il)Ex. Also, you get to live in Nexus, which is nice. So if you're interested, please contact me (/u/Defmork), UnlikelyVictim (/u/kittenbears88) or another citizen of Tacitum/Nexus. You won't regret it.





Also, we're selling stone.

Is this a thing we can do on this server, maybe have cities send a small army for each war and last man standing wins his nation a prize? Plus it needs a good name for this!

I'd suggest looking at some PvP server kits (I know, le cringe) for a kit that is balanced enough that hackers don't always win. That or you could go full civcraft and make it tanky enough that numbers will almost always provide a win although I think that too detracts from PvP and part of the civilization building and community experience. Shout-out to Rident. Dis is 4 u bae.

2. Change the citadel protection values. I'd suggest this because in my opinion, citadel still isn't completely accurate with values drawn directly from the default. I think that certain blocks should have a higher reinforcement value associated with them and that using the proper tool to break them or special tools to do so should have benefits. For example, allow the creation of special breaker-class tools that are expensive and diminish the abilities of the player using them in PvP. Basically chests shouldn't have such high reinforcements because really it's not that hard to smash open a container but solid blocks that are a cubic meter of stone, wood, or obsidian are definitely need a boost in terms of how hard they are to break with traditional tools. Basically, protect your valuables with walls and make sure that they and your builds in general are better protected from quick griefs made by players who need to defend themselves at the same time. (Force a conflict to fully resolve before any large amounts of change can take place, wow I can really think of stuff when I should be wrapping up an assignment)

3. Shops. In a server that is heavily based on trade and cooperation between players, the ability to get stuff done or prepare to go chase griefers can be completely destroyed by somebody being offline. Shops would allow players to sell goods to one another while offline and would also create some interesting businesses in property management and sale as shopping centers move around.

4. Create some way to spawn in the dragons. Just like the wither, players would like to be able to spawn in dragons to slay. It should probably be expensive but in a way that simply takes time to invest upfront and then will pay out in a fairly renewable way, especially because dragons offer unique drops. This would be similar to how it takes a long time to make a decent wither skeleton farm (slabbing, etc.) so it should probably involve either creating unique drops from monsters (I could do this :D) or investing resources into creating a sort of summoning arena/totem/area or both.

Anyways, thanks for reading this! I'd also like feedback because I'm hoping to get back into the server (time permitting) and I'd like to know how well these ideas fit, hear their shortcomings, hear similar ideas or, any tweaks!",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,3170,40,,

167090471,2rhbtz,1420518700,1,0,NotAnotherDalak,A quick user's guide for server plugins,http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2rhbtz/a_quick_users_guide_for_server_plugins/,"Since the information of the current server plugins has been buried and there isn't much information for newer players I have decided to create a user's guide for server plugins. 

Here is the current list of all the plugins on the server:

  
* ApocBan - Allows for PvE and PvP deathbans, 1 minute and 10 minutes respectively.
* BoatTweaks - Boats can only be broken by players, colliding with a squid kills it.
* Brewery - Adds way for players to craft alcohol.
* ChairsReloaded - You can sit on chairs by right clicking on them if there are signs placed on the sides of it.
* ChatTweaks - Adds /reply command.
* Citadel - Allows for block reinforcement/grief protection. Stone = 32 block-breaks, Iron = 128 block-breaks, Diamond = 512 block-breaks.
* CombatLog - When you are hit by another player it will combat log you. Logging out during this time will instantly kill you.
* Custom Recipes - Allows for the creation of new recipes. Players can now craft mossy cobblestone (vine + cobble), mossy stone bricks (vine + stone brick), cracked stone bricks (stone brick in a furnace) and chiseled stone bricks (2 vertical stone slabs). Cobwebs are created by surrounding one slime ball with 8 string. 
* NameLayer - Required by Citadel.
* CoreProtect - Server backups/rollback options.
* DisableCommands - Disables some commands.
* DragonAttack - Dragons will come and fuck up your sheep. #TruFact
* EnchantmentLimiter - Disables Protection I - IV, disables Fire/Blast/Projectile Protection II - IV. 
* LocalChat - Can only hear players with certain range (1km), does not limit /tell
* NoCheatPlus - Cheating/hacking prevention.
* JukeAlert - Players can create snitches which monitor areas. 
* RandomSpawn - Spawn in a random area.
* RealisticBiomes - Changes growth rates of renewable resources per biome.
* RealWeather - Adds weather- and temperature-based effects to the game.
* PlayerSpeedAPI - Required by RealWeather.
* PortalTweaks - Disables End Portals, alters Nether portals to work at 1:1 ratio instead of 1:8, disabled Gold Farms.
* PrisonPearl - Allows players to imprison others. The cost of maintaining a pearl is 8 ingots a day.
* WorldBorder - Limits the size of the world.
* WorldGuard - Denies players from using certain items (Ender Pearls, Ender Chests, Strength potions).
* WorldEdit - Required by WorldGuard.
* XpTweaks - Emerald Block XP storage, Emerald XP retrieval


Now time for the big hitters and the ones new players have trouble with. Lets learn how to use Citadel, Prison Pearl, and JukeAlert.

Citadel: Citadel is a block protection plugin which allows players to reinforce blocks using certain resources. Here is a [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/kHJVX.jpg) explaining how to use citadel. Please note the values for that are wrong. Stone = 32 block-breaks, Iron = 128 block-breaks, Diamond = 512 block-breaks. Citadel also allows you to do wonderful things like creating reinforcement groups. Here you can see all the citadel [commands.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/)

Prison Pearl: Prison pearl gives players the ability to imprison other players. By killing another player with a pearl in your hot-bar you will successfully pearl them. The way I always explain this to new players is that this plugin is what separates the server from other servers. Prison pearl gives players the ability to enforce their own rules and this is what is different. Your actions have consequences and if you break other nation's laws you may find yourself in the end. Here is another little infographic on how to use [prisonpearl.](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) The cost of keeping a pearl stored is 8 ingots a day which means if the pearl isn't stored in a chest with the proper amount of gold the pearls will be freed upon login.

JukeAlert: Whether you know it or not, you've already used this plugin. JukeAlert allows players to reinforce jukeboxes and noteblocks and turn them into snitches. What does it mean if a jukebox or a noteblock is a snitch? Well for starters its like a camera. But it doesn't provide film. Jukeboxes will save logs of everthing that happens within a 11 blocks radius of the block. They also ping users the coordinates of the snitch, the name of it, and the player who entered the snitch field. Noteblocks will only ping users and they do not store logs. You guessed it, here is another [infographic.](http://i.imgur.com/t9DaPOS.png)

I first got on, typed in a enthusiastic hello, and got this in my chat area.  

""There is no one close enough to hear you...""

Now, let me tell you that that message was not a pleasant one.  I continued typing until someone, apparently in the forest and near death, asked me where I was.  

Now, I'm not usually too welcoming.  But hey, this guy wanted help, and I had nothing, so I gave him my coordinates and he promptly... died.  

So, after hearing that once you die you respawn in a new area, I promptly killed myself, only to spawn one minute later in...

The mountians.  Not the small ones like I currently live in, but huge ones.  I didn't see a single tree.  I started dying, and, because I had no idea what was happening, went along with it, and died again, until I respawned in...

Probably somewhere near Greyshore.  I was in a forest, and typed out.  Sloth_Rocks helped me out, gave me food.  He took me around to the river (which I was stunned at.  It looks amazing, and I was shocked once I saw it.).  He walked me past the lighthouse, and briefly over the bridge to see it.  I considered asking to stay there, but I wanted to see what ""Brandenburg"" was.  I play EU4, so I was expecting some German culture groups, a nice military, a core on... you know what?  I'm going off track.  Sorry.  

But when I got there, it was fantastic.  I hopped on the teamspeak, and went to Brandenburg, and got some of the plugins explained (although, now, the TS is down).  

But, all in all, it was certainly a welcoming first day.  I won't be leaving for a few hours, so you can find me as Macrat7!  Thank you for the warm welcome, keep up the awesome work guys.  ",6,CivilizatonExperiment,,1752,17,,

Third day of the second month  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The people have told us about their history. Not much has happened in their past, they just happened to find this place and settled down. They appear interested in our culture, as I said before, but for some reason they are obsessed with the way we name our men and areas. Some of them have even considered naming their children after dwarves. Their leader kept asking me questions about Moria, so I told him about the riches that lay there, deep under the ground. But sadly, it got dark again, so we had to leave them for the night.

Fourth day of the second month  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Today they showed us a map of their continent, which they allowed me to copy. They didn’t have any names for any areas, so I have already started to name them. I have also started to remember bits and pieces of a different language, and I have used that language for some places on that map, just as exercise. I have attached the map to the next page. One of them suggested to name their area after our big mines, because they also have many gemstones under their mountains. I have also used their writing, just to try it out.

Two-thousand, seven-hundred and seventy-one, T. A.

First day of the second month  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have arrived at an island. Our ship was brought here by the winds. The only person awake when the island came in sight was knocked unconscious because he hit is head against the mast, so nobody saw the island coming. Sigh. When that Imump woke up, he woke us all up. We came here from the north-east, so the part where we have arrived must be the part furthest up north. We have yet to find any inhabitants. The terrain is very cold and windy.

Second day of the second month  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Today we found some local people. They seemed pretty nice. They write in a different script, but strangely they speak the same language as us. We told them a bit about our backstory. How the dragon Smaug came and destroyed the city of Dale, how it broke in to our mountain and forced us to flee from out own home. How we were forced to take a boat to a better land, leaving behind our brethren. They seemed interested. However, it got dark before they were able to tell us about them. That will maybe happen tomorrow.

* **What timezone do you live in/Where do you live?**

* **Please tell us a bit about yourself!**
	
* **Since when have you started playing on the server?**

* **Do you have any experience as server administrator or moderator? If so, please elaborate.**

* **How would you contribute to this server by being a staff member?**

* **Do you have any shortcomings you feel like you can improve on?**	

* **Can you accept the fact that you must enforce the server rules and moderator guidelines under any circumstance?**	

* **How many hours would you be able to spend on this server every week?**

* **Have you watched Interstellar? If so, what's your opinion about it?** 

* **Do you have any additional questions or comments?**	

Please send this form with all questions answered to **civilizationexperiment@gmail.com** with as subject **Civilization Experiment moderator application by [username]**.

But others are heavily against this. The main reasons for a map reset are *too many diamonds* and *too small island*.

But instead of a map reset, we could add a second island. The island would be bigger than the main island and look different/have different biomes. And to fix the diamond problem, there could be close to none at the new island. This would spread the same amount of diamonds over more than twice the space, and make them more valuable.

The addition of a second island could be achieved in several ways:

* **Multiverse**  
We could use the plugin [Multiverse](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/). It allows multiple worlds and portals between them. The second island could be a different map, and players could create portals to travel between worlds.

* **MCEdit Schematic**  
This would require more downtime and a ton of work, but would make the second island accessible without a portal. After the new island is made and exported from WorldPainter (I assume that is what Yourself used for the first island) to a Minecraft save, it could be made into one giant schematic or a few smaller schematics. The schematics could then be inserted into the map using MCEdit.

Of course, it's up for the admins to decide, but I personally think a second island would be cool.

**Edit:** I don't think this should happen now or anytime soon. But when there are more players and more land is claimed, this would be useful for nations. There could also be some special second island-only items, so there would be trade to and from the island.",5,CivilizatonExperiment,,1615,25,Suggestion,bug

 * Vanilla ore generation gives certain players an edge over others. *(There wasn't suppose to be any to begin with)*
 * There's an abundance of diamonds.
 * Clay is a scarce resource, making using brick or clay structure's impossible. As well as having practical farms.
 * Sand is a scarce resource. It can pretty much only be found on beaches, seeing as the desert only has a couple layers. As well, it makes it impossible to make sandstone structures seeing as there's no sandstone generation.

**You can vote on whether or not you would like a map reset [here](http://strawpoll.me/3324034).**

I have a solution to benefit the server, and those who I have wronged, it's pretty simple actually. I got a new account mainly for Civcraft called ""Enderphile"" I use it to visit the End on civcraft, but I'll most likely be using it full time here. I talked to Phaxar and he basically said if he keeps NerdChops banned, and just let Enderphile play on the server, things should work okay. I won't even transfer my citadel groups over, NerdChops can't do a single thing on the server ever again. Instead, Enderphile will. 

**What will I be doing?**   
I'm going to peacefully turn myself in as long as my pearler (someone in Nexus) agrees to these terms below, and do my End time reforming the end, and making it easier for criminals to re-pay those they did wrong.

* I am not completely perma-pearled.

* You provide me with the supplies I need to make the End habitable (saplings lava and water for a stone gen, a stack of glowstone, and  seeds).

I'm going to make the End an easier place to reform criminals, much like Mandy has on Civcraft. Crops and trees will grow, just rather slowly, so clay would be nice too, but not necessary I suppose.
___________________________________________________________
I'm not trying to make anyone's time in the end easier, but I want to clean it up and make it easier for criminals to pay reparations to those who they did wrong to.

Once I'm un-pearled, I""ll probably send my pearl to Rev-State where I can continue work in the end, but with more access to the Overworld for easier supply.

If you have any questions or objections, please go ahead and say something.

**Location:** [West coast Desert region - Mount Wyck.](http://imgur.com/V3Zh36Y)  
**Government:** Theocratic Oligarchy - Fire worshipers  
**Main Deity** - Mother Sun.  
**Demigods** - First Man. 
  
**Government Expanded**      
Wyck is governed by the Wyckish Council, which is lead by the Wyckish Overlord.  
    
**The Wyckish Council** is responsible for managing the growth and prosperity of Wyck within it's borders regarding all matters including, but not limited to, city and state planning, legislation, and taxes. The Council acts as judge and jury in all legal matters related to the citizens of Wyck.  
Council seats are appointed by the Council. There are no elections in Wyck.
  
**The Wyckish Overlord** is responsible for managing all of Wyck's interactions with the outside world including, but not limited to, trade agreements, war making, peace treaties, and expanding the borders of Wyck. The Overlord acts as arbiter for all deadlocked Council issues.  
Only Council Members may become Overlord and only by defeating the current Overlord in ritualized single combat.  
  
**Wyckish Creation Story:**   
The First Man was alone in the darkness and cold. Each day Mother Sun would fly by and warm him. Determined to never be farm from Mother Sun's warmth, the First Man built a mountain that reached above the clouds. The next day, as Mother Sun flew by, her hair brushed the mountain peak and set it ablaze, and the First Man was content.  
Soon the First Man realized that he could no longer venture far from the mountain; the cold without had grown stronger and he struggled in vain to take the mountain's fire with him. Mother Sun saw his frustration and, in a desire to comfort him, pulled him into her embrace as she passed overhead. Mother Sun's love was too intense, and the First Man erupted in a shower of sparks and ash that covered the world. The ash gave life to the cold dark soil and soon all the trees and plants of the forest sprang forth, and a multitude of animals and birds burrowed and nested and thrived. The sparks drifted far and wide and became the sons and daughters of Mother Sun and First Man.  
  
**Present Day:** The Wyckish people have returned to the mountain of their birth, Mount Wyck. First Man gave us Mount Wyck, Mother Sun gave us life, and the Wyckish will give the earth the fire and flame it deserves.

As shall be clearly obvious already, we have access to a shit ton of alternate accounts, access to a shit ton of IP address, and access to a shit ton of members. So please, hear us out.

The Black Knights were founded in some month of 2013, solely for one purpose. To get revenge on Itaqi for kicking me out of Orion. The city that WE built together. I gathered up some of my friends and we went in to burn down their forest. After that, 3-4 months of random attacks and greifings ensued. I was later banned for admitting to hacking.

After that fiasco, we started alt gathering for about 2-3 weeks straight, knowing we were in for the fight of a lifetime. A 3$ month vpn server later, we continued to fight. And we fought. And. we. fought.

All I wanted was for Itaqi to apologize and allow me to reclaim my piece of the throne. But, he said no.

Some more shit later, and then we became a full out greifing team. I want to tell you something. Something, from the bottom of my heart. Unlike some other greifing teams who just come out of nowhere to attack players, we were good once. Each and everyone of our members was as good as can be, but we were all reduced to scum just because someone wanted the limelight. We don't recruit any old person. We recruit the divergents.

Let me tell you, we were all good. once. But, if greedy people did not become greedy people, I would not be typing this right now.

Now, we are not open to forgiveness. I just want one simple thing from all of you. To allow us to live in peace. Because everytime someone rips on us, lies to us, and acts like a ballsack around us (fuk u itaqi), your just one more person added to our hit list.

Its simple, leave us alone, and we will leave you alone. (Also, were not done with nexus yet. Or greyshore. Or moria.)

Just one simple request. Leave us be, and we will leave you be. If the mods keep banning us, what iReloaded4DaWin did to greyshore will seem like childs play to the offending moderators city.

A dream of a grand nation of unrivaled scientific prowess, filled with machines and contraptions of intricate engineering, bringing a golden age to the lands of CivilEx where all would rejoice and live in perfect utopia. What started as a game, quickly gave way to something larger and became a major part of my life, for such was the dedication with which I applied myself, often sacrificing other aspects of my personal life.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~Alas, my vision did not come true. Of the three and a half months of this server, I've played for longer than a full month. My statistics page reads 33 days logged on and counting. Yet I didn't even come close to realizing my extravagant reveries. I suppose very few people in this server actually possessed the necessary expertise to aid me in seeing them through, such was the grandeur of my fancies, yet I failed to recruit even a single one of those. Still, I made friends. Many friends. Mbach231, Bouer, Falquador, Savvytrue, Rident, Sloths_Rock, Picklesane, akn429 and many, many others. You are all very special to me.~~ 

&amp;nbsp;

~~And then there was Alison, of course. I'm very sorry I failed you. To you, I leave all I have achieved, though it be far from what I once envisioned. Do with it what you will. I do not blame you for defecting, though it breaks my heart to reminisce of erstwhile days when we'd spend countless hours just talking well into the night. I've poured hours upon hours on toiling alone, to distract myself from the inevitable demise of my civilization, but my heart's no longer in it. It's just easier this way. I cannot bear the loneliness, and I dare not trouble you further with my hopeless entreatments.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~I deeply regret leaving you all, but I fear my willpower to continue investing in this game is inexorably withering away. I stand alone in the shadow that is Omnitopia, once so filled with mirth now simply a land of broken, forlorn dreams.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~Farewell and best of luck in all your future endeavors, people of CivilEx. The Illuminati is, regrettably, no more.~~
&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

~~I might be overthinking this, as I often do, but as it stands I'm quite discouraged at my prospects. I suppose the response I get from this will determine the ultimate fate of Omnitopia.~~

Therefore, if we are attacked, we will fall easily.

We are not well defended, and we wish our neighbors would make defense pacts with us and help us defend against forces that wish to take our quaint little underwater settlement.

In return, we are unable to give you a correct military force. We can, however, stop all trade with your enemies, and attempt to lower trade with such an enemy in the near future. On your side, for pledging to protect us, you will be given improved trade opportunity and, when completed, a discounted price for a spot in our mega-vault, the Aquarium.

Please think about this proposal. We are a pacifistic nation in a dangerous world, and need military support.

Thank you,

Mods, you can take Golden Coast's flair off, as it is being dissolved. Today, we witness the demise of the first starter nation.

In related news, I will no longer be updating the flairs of the subreddit /r/civexcirclejerk to parody current nations (although not many nations have changed). If someone wants to do it, i'll mod them. As a reminder, remember to funnel joke posts there.

So I've come up with a solution: A grand alliance of many nations, where we can all work together as one giant alliance, free of conflict, free to use one another's land with no borders dividing us. Now, don't let my ""USSR"" flair fool you, I'm not planning on going full communist on you all; I was thinking something more along the lines of the European Union, minus the fascism.

Unless, of course, you guys *want* communism ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) .

So, guys, what do you think? Any suggestions? Better name? Rules for joining? Anything? Anyone interested?

EDIT: Ok, this is what we have so far: ""Fuzzy"" borders. You can gather resources in other peoples territories, and buildings built on the wrong side of a border are no big deal. However, you cannot just go and build anywhere on someone else's claim without permission, and most certainly not in an area that is in use (I'm looking at you, feds)

So I'm trying to find a town to help around, build and overall do things in.


Why?

* I want to meet new people, and hopefully make new friends!
* It sounds fun, I've been playing Minecraft for ages: this sounds like something interesting I haven't tried before.
* I need a town, because it's better than starving in a small dirt hole like I currently am.


So yeah, some details about myself: I'm of the 'boy' gender, and am currently 17 years old living who is fairly easy-going. I have TS and a decent-ish microphone and can be pretty active on the server. 


I'm fairly bad at building and fairly bad at PvE, but I'm sure there's place for a village idiot in most towns :P So yeah, if I'm allowed to join you, just reply &lt;3 I'll probably check back on this post in the morning.

4. After you're done with your fotoshoot, open up **%appdata%**. If you don't know how to do this, press the **Windows Key + R** Type %appdata% in the window that opens, and press Ok. Next up, open **roaming** in the %appdata%, then go to .minecraft, then click on Screenshots. You should be able to find your screenshots in there.
For mac users: Open up Finder and click Go in the menu bar. Hold down Option/Alt and click Library. Open the folder called Application Support. In Application Support you open minecraft, and then screenshots. You should be able to find your screenshots in there.

5.  Upload your screenshots to www.imgur.com, and send the link to your images/album to **civilizationexperiment@gmail.com** titled, **Screenshot submission by [username]**. Please include in the email where/what the places are you made the screenshots!

Here's a solution to the Lysos/Revolution state problem. I hope you take the time to read it! Was gonna write down more, but I'm lazy! This proposal means profit for both parties and doesn't hurt Lysos nor RS! 

* Lysos merges (Sounds better than being annexed) together with Revolution State
* Revolution State becomes the parent (I really wouldn't know a better word for it) of Lysos. This means the following:
 * Lysos may rely on the army Revolution State at any time when attacked.
 * Citizens in Lysos are free to choose if they want to participate in the army of Revolution State or not. There won't be a seperate army for Lysos, a part of the current Revolution State
 * Revolution State gains control of all the land with it's resources claimed by Lysos, and is allowed to break/build any blocks on it. Lysos and it's citizens neither lose or gain any rights. Revolution State is not allowed to mess up the top blocks of sand beaches in Lysos's land claim, but are allowed to remove the sand below that.

* Lysos is allowed to decide if they'd like to enforce their own law and constitution of Revolution State or their own.
* If a crime is commited in Lysos territory, Revolution State's army should protect the players in Lysos Territory and catch the commiter of the crime if possible.

So here's how Amani Kingdom as a state entity is organized around its monarchy and social hierarchy.

From the Amani subreddit sidebar:

&gt; We are a Kingdom. This means that we are led by our King who is at the top of the hierarchy. The King will lead the nation from the capital, other cities will be founded too which can be led by Advisors, Dukes or Knights

The Amani hierarchy is a 4 tiered system consisting of, in order: The King, The Upper Nobility, The Lesser Nobility, and the Common People. 

* The King is the highest authority in the kingdom. He provides direction and leadership. Major decisions regarding diplomacy, warfare, and internal policy must be made by or approved by the king.

* The Upper Nobility consists of members with the title of Duke. Dukes are given important managerial positions such as city mayors, territorial governors, and minister posts for the nation under appointment from the king. Upper nobles also receive privileges such as access to high level citadel groups including beacons, vaults, and valuables storage. In the future, Duke titles may be connected to land stewardship for the kingdom.

* The Lesser Nobility consists of members with the title of Knight. Knights are also given important managerial positions, although these positions are generally over specific tasks. These tasks can include projects, direct service under a duke, and notably military leadership. In the case of military leadership, knights manage formal military units by ensuring their upkeep, training, and providing combat direction. However, as military leaders knights may not arm or deploy their units without the express order or permission of the King or relevant  Duke. While Knights do not receive special privileges like Dukes, they still hold official authority.

* The Common People serve as the base of Amani society. Their role in the government is limited to following laws and directives passed down from the King. Government involvement can be found through service in a military unit under a knight and employment in a government project. Commoners are not expected to give courtesies to nobility beyond obeying official authority. 

Movement up and down the hierarchy can only take place through promotion or demotion by the King. Promotions/demotions are considered based displayed potential, actual performance, and loyalty. 

The Amani state is built on the King providing direction and decisions for the nation. The nobility fills the management role of ensuring the King's directives and decisions are fulfilled. Upper Nobles perform large scale management and Lesser Nobles perform mirco-scale management. In this way the Amani Kingdom has an official and functional state entity.",4,CivilizatonExperiment,,2928,3,,

* I need gold swords from every nation that entered. Plain, and I will name them myself with my own xp. They will be kept and re-used every time, don't worry!

* The choosing will be completely random, and I plan to have multiple people present. I could possibly set a date in a city and you could show up if you wish to witness the said act. (Most likely Greyshore since it is somewhat central)

* If you were playing Civcraft about 8 months ago, you might think you remember the rules, but I highly encourage you to re-read them when they are released. Everyone forgets things, even me every once in a while.

* If my stuff was stolen while I was gone someone will die.^^^^Getn....^^&lt;3

* **You can now enchant armour up with normal protection up to level I.**
 * Written by Mbach:

 &gt;So after much debate and discussion, we decided to re-enable Prot I. The reasoning behind the decision was because we felt like in order to help balance weapon dmg versus armor defenses, something needed to change. Many people have reported that Alch Prot isn't common enough to completely negate Harm pots (though having a full set of AP IV should completely negate all Harm dmg), and Sharpness is still somewhat powerful without Prot.
&gt;
This basically left us with 2 options; further limit Sharpness and look into removing/weakening Harm, or simply re-adding Protection. So for now, we're going with re-adding Protection I to see how that affects the gameplay. We hope people will be satisfied with the change and eagerly await feedback on whether or not this is actually helping balance combat like we expect it should.

They aren't. Here's what little story there is.  
  
The day Dwauz first came to the server I helped him out with food and supplies, like I have many people. Wyck tries to be aggressive in befriending new players because it helps retain them, and we want to see the server prosper. Dwauz is 13, well below our age limit for Wyck, but he was very polite and friendly and happens to be the same age as some of our member's sons, so I told him he was welcome to join Wyck if he wanted to.  
  
Dwauz said he was all about PvP and diamonds, which we don't have in the desert, so he and his friend Nackky_, who I also supplied with a starter kit, set off north and said they would stop back in to Wyck some time. That was the last we spoke, other than once or twice saying hi when one of us signed on.  
  
I signed on today and immediately received a message from Dwauz saying something to the effect of ""I had to leave Wyck since I've generated some animosity towards myself here"". Immediately after that I started getting messages from Nerdchops and Twitchingtons telling me that Dwauz and C4M8 had been raiding and saying they were from Wyck.  
  
To make a long story short, I helped them out when they first joined, they seemed like nice enough kids, they clearly aren't and now I'm dealing with their mess.  
  
I'm issuing a KOS bounty on Dwauz, C4M8, and Nackky_ (spelling might be off by a letter on their names, but it'll be obvious if it's them when you see them on the server). I'm going to pay a stack of diamonds per pearl and reimburse any armor or weapons lost in the hunt. I have a mountain of gold, so their pearls will remain in a chest of gold forever.  
  
Anyone who was griefed or raided by them please get in contact with me so I can reimburse you.

Rev-State came up with a plan to lead them into Rev-State as friends, and then pearl them. As far as we knew the bounty was still valid (which is was). Today they finally showed up, so me and coco killed Dwauz. Soon after C4M8 finished coco and I off, we were low on supplies after wasting them on Dwauz, and I wasn't aware coco had low tier diamond weapons. 
[I was pearled as a result](http://i.imgur.com/Ro0qAqf.png)

Once I was freed coco and I ran over to reload and get more gear as they had stolen the good stuff off of our corpses. I had more than enough diamonds, but sadly didn't have time to enchant anything.
Thus, resulting in coco and I getting our asses handed to us for over an hour. [We then resorted to a clever plan to lure them into a nether portal that would take them to a pit to die,](http://i.imgur.com/hrYDLoB.png) but they had already ran off before it was too late.

Wyck has some members who are happy to mine endlessly and help fulfill gold orders but for the most part we are still trying to get our city established, and that takes a great deal of time. We are almost done leveling off the top of the mountain, and once that's done we can begin building permanent structures. As you may have seen in NerdChops post with pictures of Wyck, we are living in a bit of a temporary shanty town until the real buildings can go up.  
  
We aren't interested in driving up the price of gold, we just don't have the necessary time or interest at the moment to mine large amounts, and like every other nation we need a certain amount for our own infrastructure (rail lines and horses mostly).  
  
Diamonds are fun to mine and the reason we play MC is to have fun. Gold isn't fun to mine. Even when you find large amounts its still kind of ""meh"". Mining diamonds also results in emeralds and iron. Mining gold also results in iron and coal, meh. Fortune picks make mining diamonds even more exciting. Fortune doesn't work on gold.  
  
When I tell the citizens of Wyck that they can get 2:1 on any gold they mine their response is ""I'll just mine my own diamonds."" When I tell them they can get 1:1 its still not as exciting as mining diamonds, but they don't have to travel all the way across the continent to get diamonds.  
  
So, if you want gold without having to mine it, Wyck will be trading at 1:1. If we never make another gold trade because of that it'll just mean we have more time to build ;)  
  
There is still a lot of unclaimed desert, mostly at the northern and southern tips of the desert, so obviously people who don't want to pay that rate can continue to mine their own gold. New nations or existing nations can also consider moving to the unclaimed areas and settling down. We never mind new neighbors. It's fairly quiet in the desert and it would actually be nice to get some other activity down here anyways.  
  
Thanks.

Even though most of our natural resources are in and under mountains, we have a wonderful location to get around in the map.

We were recently vassalized by Tacitum, an outpost of Nexus around our land, however, we still follow our own rules. They can't force you to do anything, and, in fact, it helps you out.  You can work for payment, and you can travel around the map from the railroad junction nearby.

If you love to PVP, then maybe Brandenburg isn't the right place to be.  We have been involved in a few conflicts, but it's nothing to worry about.  Again, if something happens, I have many back up plans.  

To our southwest is Greyshore, to our west is Rev. State, and to our east is Brandywine.  All of this allows Brandenburg easy access to other towns and players on the server!

We're a group of friends who have been gaming together for years and hang out on our private Teamspeak server most nights of the week. Our average age is 28 and about half of us have kids of our own. We keep it mature, we keep it fun, and we keep it real.  
  
In order to join Wyck you have to be at least 21 years old and use Teamspeak. If we can't hear you talk we can't let you into Wyck. If you do have Teamspeak make sure your voice isn't too high pitched, that could get annoying. Make sure your voice isn't too low, that might be too intimidating. Don't talk too much, or we'll call you toxicfox 2.0 (Toxicfox talked to much and has since been handled). Don't refrain from talking or we might think you're a basement dweller.  
  
We play othe games too. Mostly LoL, WoW, CS:GO, and DayZ lately.  
  
So, if you're an adult and you're looking for more than just a town to give you food and armor because you can't hack it on your own, consider Wyck and maybe, if you're lucky, we'll consider you too!",4,CivilizatonExperiment,,1162,17,Propaganda,inquiry

Hello there aspiring Morian's! While many nations are recruiting right now, and offering such *awesome* rewards for joining, we at Moria can give you so much more! Currently, Moria is by far the largest, and most brutal claim out of the nations. To live in this climate you must learn how to survive day and night in the harsh blizzard's that plague our land; not only must you survive, but you have to progress! All current members of Moria are dedicated to building towns, villages, ports, and much more! If you plan on joining, now would be the time, you can create and dictate your own town, build your own stronghold, and even build world wonders!  :D 

**PvPers**

Of course, if surviving and building isn't for you, then there's always a spot for you in the military! Like any other nation, Moria must defend ourselves and our allies that depend on us for support if a fight, or war breaks out. Joining the military means you'll be the vanguard in any fight, defending and fighting for Moria's sovereignty! When recruits join the military, they are outfitted with standard diamond armor and weapons, and of course potions! After a weeks trial in the military you'll no longer be a recruit, and therefor get access to the Morian, and Morian military's sub-reddit, and go from standard armor to enchanted armor :D Our motto in the military is ""The blizzard thins out the weak, and leaves only the strong"", will you survive the blizzard? 

**Contact Info**

You can join by contacting me, /u/janego99 (IGN: GetNgoing), or /u/bouer (IGN: Bouer). If you wanna look around at our main city, the coordinates are 10000, 2100. Make sure to bring some leather!",10,CivilizatonExperiment,,1683,10,,

We're a smallish nation (5 members right now) located under the sea, in a small stone brick box off the coast of Eryndor (North-west part of the Island). We are the only underwater sovereign nation in CivEx, so that makes us special.

We're based around trade and diplomatics, we're the Civ V Venice of Civ Ex, if you would. We have a large growing influence over many nations, and this only ~~fuels our plot to destroy the world~~ helps our economics with the world.

I am wnc321, but you can call me wnc. I have been running amok around your server for the past month-ish, going to and fro from random hobbit holes I made (If you find random chests in-between the northwest and north middle, those were probably me).

I have been attempting to hobbit your server like any 3rd world human would, without visiting or getting into the subreddit at all, not even to find the locations of places, etc. 

A few days ago, I decided to travel south (according to my F3 menu), and I came across the land of Omnitopia (mushroom island). Eventually, I made it into their rail line, and rode it to a junction. Because I did not know how to work it, I ended up losing my minecart, and getting stuck in the contraption. Eventually, I broke out (sorry, but I had no glass to fix my mess), and starving, I rode my emergency boat back north when I ran into a farm (which was Omnitopias, according to the sign). Starving, losing health, and with no food, I jumped into the potato farm and attempted to break the plants, but to no avail. Eventually, I found one plant that was not protected (thank god) and I got out of it. I then went inside and killed 2 pigs for the meat. As I was placing signs down saying I was sorry, some people were coming up from the shore, so as any smart player would do, I hid.

Said players chased me down a hill and into the ocean and they had deadly accurate bow shots (like, they trained for ever. Every single one hit me in the head and never missed.) I logged off with a heart left, so I decided to visit the reddit to see what this was about. A few hours later, LunisequiouS posted some info on the players. At that moment, I figured I should make this post, and here it is.

I just wanted to know if those guys are gone, so I could come back up and possibly get a little more food. Again, sorry for breaking a crop and killing some of your animals.

Thanks,

wnc321

We've managed to recover some of the stock but decided to start breeding from scratch again and so we're selling the surviving stock for a bargain.

This is a temporary offer and noticeably cheaper than the original prices charged through [OmniSteeds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNU4yrg0gBYNizprj4vdOjuAs7bkZPK7NUId0LLzM5M/edit?pli=1#gid=82943055), though since that spreadsheet lists several mounts that are no longer available we're doing this special, limited time sale to renew our stocks!

These are horses and mules of the highest quality, with speeds ranging from 11.5 to 12.5, jump between 2.5 and 4.0 and health between 19 and 26.

All for the price of a stack of iron blocks with free delivery anywhere in the map. Buy early and get the very best steeds while offers last!

(Also selling donkeys for the same price, but since they're so slow, you'll have to come pick them up when I'm online).

The next RRR will be held in March.

The event will have [its own subreddit, /r/RadRetroRun](http://www.reddit.com/r/RadRetroRun/), where future information about the event will be posted and runners will be able to post about their experiences in the game.
***
###But how the heck can I play Earthbound?
You can either play the original on the SNES, buy it in the Wii U eShop or run it on your computer. Since the first 2 options are easy enough, here's a guide to installing the game and an emulator on your PC:

1. **Get an emulator that works with SNES roms.**  
For Mac users, I strongly recommend using [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/). For Windows and Linux users I recommend [Snes9x](http://www.snes9x.com/downloads.php). Install the emulator (if you need help installing, there is help documented on the linked websites).
2. **Get an Earthbound rom.**  
This one is the same on all OSes. Simply google ""Earthbound rom"" and click the first link (it should be EmuParadise.me). Scroll down to the part labeled ""Direct Download Links"" and click the orange link. Scroll down to ""Direct download"" and click the orange link thats called exactly the same as what you clicked on earlier. Wait 20 seconds, and a .zip file will be downloaded. This .zip file contains your rom file.
3. **Using the rom** (Mac)  
Unzip the zip file. The zip will have extracted to ""Earthbound (USA).sfc"" or something similar. *Make sure it ends in .sfc.* Now you should open OpenEmu. Click ""File"" in the menubar and then click ""Add to Library..."". Select your .sfc file in the pop-up menu. In the sidebar, click ""Recently added"". You should be able to find it the game there. Once found, double-click the icon to start the game.
3. **Using the rom** (Windows &amp; Linux)  
Follow [this simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F2oMK-NDmQ), it explains it better than I can.

However I see some festering problems that I can see leading to disaster. Having seen the death of Civrealms and a few others I know what these threats look like. 

You guys need to promote more. Like a ton. I've been looking for a server like this for a while now and never found it. Getting new people on and keeping them active is an absolute must for everyone to have a good time. 

Secondly you guys made a good choice in implementing an anti griefing stance. No one likes to see their projects ruined. We are all here to have fun with each other (even or possibly especially violently) . Not at the expense of each other. Make sure you keep at this and encourage positive player behavior. 

Speaking of positive behavior. Make sure you welcome new players with open arms and give em the means to get started. Events between settlements ect. Making this place feel like a community will keep this place alive. 

Just some advice. I guess. I like this place and I don't wanna see it die like the others. ",12,CivilizatonExperiment,,1123,6,,

It's happened with quite a few people so I hope nobody feels bad about it or anything, just wanted to help you guys so you all know :)

Modmail is our Moderator Mail for the subreddit. When you send messages here all of the mods/admin for the server can see it and help. Our new test moderators Lunisequious and Defmork do not have access to modmail at this point in time. 
This is a better thing to use than individually messaging admins/mods because more people can see it and then you have more of a chance of something being worked out. 

If you look on the right side of the main subreddit then scroll down you'll see something that looks like [this](http://imgur.com/WY7kDUN) without the big red arrow. Just click the link and send us a message and we'll be able to sort stuff out easily :) It is kinda small and not super noticeable so it's kinda easy to miss at first.

TPRK will be divided into two cities, which is why the claim is so large. I will be the leader of Pyongyang, and my brother, Seoul.

We're close to Queenston upon sea, Sky Utopia, and The Reach, so if you guys have any problems with our claim we will adjust, but we're pretty happy with the current claim.

The Omni-Alliance is an alliance of sovereign states who have agreed to join said group of their own volition. Membership secures several rights to each of the member states and allows them to act as one if necessary, supporting the efforts of one another and defending themselves from harm.

Here is a summary of the main points states need to agree to whilst formally joining the Alliance:

- The decisions of the Alliance are made by a council formed of the leaders or representatives of every nation bound by it. A council leader may readily appoint another member to take his or her place in Alliance dealings. The Council is currently composed of Bouer (Moria), spawn__point (Survival Union), Pon__ (Sky Utopia), Falquador (Amani Kingdom), ImNotBanksy (Xhakum). These decisions are then overseen by the Chairman of the Omni-Alliance, Lunisequious (Omnitopia).

- Residence is permitted for members of the alliance within the territory of any member states. Trading is encouraged and given priority between member states and prices should be 50% of what is charged to other nations. Members of the alliance are exempted from any tolls or fees charged of other players in the territories of member states.

- Member states are expected to collaborate with materials to foment the construction of common infrastructure such as vaults, railways, embassies and etc. to the best of their abilities.

- A member of the Alliance may request comments and input from the council and these should be readily addressed within the shortest possible time frame. Should no official response be delivered, support is assumed given favorable relations between the member states.

- Should any of the member states be attacked or threatened, the other states in the Alliance should promptly come to its defense, providing military power and assistance in any way, shape or form they are able to. Member states are free to rally and request support from one another whenever they see fit in order to secure cooperation for their own efforts.

- The member states are not allowed to wage war against one another. Internal conflicts must be resolved with diplomacy and in an amicable fashion, by bringing the issue to the Council. Should they be on opposite sides of a coalition, they must refrain from attacking or undermining other member states in any way. This extends to conflicts between individual members of the nations in the alliance as well, who are encouraged to present the council with their arguments rather than taking the matter on their own hands.

- Should any member state issue a call to war, the other member states are required to listen and provide military personnel and gear to aid in the campaign to the best of their abilities. Withdrawing or not participating citing personal reasons is possible but heavily discouraged, and may incur penalties from the council.

- A member state who fails to comply with the aforementioned terms may be sanctioned or in dire cases, removed from the alliance completely. A member state who is removed can only rejoin if 2/3s of the inner council agree with its request. Any member state is free to leave the alliance of their own volition at any time they see fit, provided they are not being coerced to do so by foreign organizations.

This server is an experiment, one based on Civilization. As far as I know, there has never been a point in human history where war wasn't existent. It is part of us, whether you like it or not, we are all war waging machines. War shapes cultures, it develops societies, strengthens bonds, it creates love, it creates hate, and it shapes the world around us. Utopia's aren't existent. They never have, and never will. This is where it leads to the experiment.

**War Is A Part Of The Civilization Experiment**

I understand some of you who enjoy building don't like your stuff getting destroyed, which can be prevented, of course. I personally love war. Call me all the names you want, but please continue to listen. We can all sit here and build until Phaxar inevitably becomes the first man to cure cancer, or we can make the experiment interesting. With no war we could all just sit around and build pointlessly. With war comes strategy. With war comes alliances. With war comes comradeship, and with war comes enemies. Do we always need to be at war? Of course not, but a little tension here and there is what this server is about, it isn't about building your E-Lego city. It is about seeing if your E-Lego city can stand the test of time. To see if it can survive highs and lows.

With this world is what you make it, so make it a fun one.

Me and /u/ekez_666 (Awolz_bro) found /r/worldbuilding, which led to here, from a power's sub reddit. (A Powers subreddit is like /r/worldpowers or /r/historicalworldpowers where you pick a spot on Earth, claim a nation and RP hard af) 

Basically, the sub itself has recently kinda died from inactivity and quitters. **The main reason for this is because of a ""One Sided World War""**. I can basically describe this in one way; two distinct sides rise against each other. They recruit EVERYONE they can on the sub(or this case the server) and go to war. The catch is this- one side is obviously the soon to be victor. A world war wouldn't be bad but, if it was all powerful nations vs one powerful nation and a handful of small ones, it's a massacre basically. That's what happened on our sub and it basically caused all the losers (roughly a half of the sub) to quit or not play anymore actively. 

So this is the point;

* Don't get involved in someone else's war if you really have no vital reason to (Ex; Borders, really, really, really great friends, etc).

* Don't create a mega alliance between* the obviously most powerful nations.

*(As in, you can be allied with a big nation but 4 big nations together is a no no)

These factors WILL kill the server in some way or another knowing from first hand experience. That is all.",4,CivilizatonExperiment,,1433,8,,

Drama is inherit in any form of politics. When large groups of people get together, bond and become a group they immediately start assigning positive aspects to their group and negative aspects to the other groups. This mentality, prevalent in all ingroups, is a breeding ground for conflict [[Additional reading]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups).

Now, this could easily be seen as a bad thing—a thing that would tear this server apart and create unrest between people—but it should be seen as a *wonderful* thing. The concept of having conflict between groups creates a realistic environment for us as players to experience the thrill of creating and banding nations together. 

Look at world news. Look at any real nation and their relationship with other nations [[Russia's annexation of Crimea]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_crisis). This server, unless I am mistaken, is to simulate the politics, economies, and infrastructure of nations. This server creates and maintains its purpose, and ladies and gentlemen, drama is a part of that equation. 

As a small note, I am not saying that I agree with one side or the other, or that any bad action, grief, or bullshit comment is forgivable because ""it happens in real life, so it's fine here"". What I am saying is that this drama here is shaping nations. There are huge alliances that are growing and devolving *and that is causing for celebration and excitement!* This fact means that this server is doing it right.

Let me tell you why this won't work:

Romans did this a while back. They gave surrounding Itaian and Latin colonies ""semi-citizenships"" without asking the colonies. But the colonies took it anyways. They now had a fraction of the political rights that normal Romans had, but the colonies didn't care. And with their new shiny citizenships, they felt Roman. And now, Rome has these kind-of Roman lackeys under their control.

Know what happened next?

Rome didn't have enough influence over that much states. Revolts. Social wars. Class wars. Etc.

If you compare and contrast CivEx with real life history, you start to see some comparisons that you can use as tactics

You can't just expect the name Omnitopia to have that much influence, you already lost most of your members to a break-off faction. (Brandywine)

You can already tell Wyck does things differently.  
  
All of robby's people have been freed, just like Sharp said they would, and the tribute The Fed planned to implement has been rescinded. robby and the CC have agreed that the temple they built is too far into The Fed land to reasonably break away, so they have agreed to let it remain as a religious temple, and point of pilgrimage, and settle somewhere new. Both Wyck and The Fed will be bringing them supplies and tools to help them get started. robbylynn12 left Teamspeak on good terms with The Fed and Wyck. *On such good terms that CC is now part of a military alliance with Wyck and The Fed*. We offered our protection to CC to allow them to grow and prosper and eventually they'll be strong enough to offer military support to us in return.  
  
The way The Fed acted was completely legal and understandable, as far as i'm concerned. Perhaps it could have been handled a little more gently, but they defended their land. Wyck holds two truths to be self evident when it comes to Nations on this server.  
1. Nations claims are only as strong as their ability to defend them.  
2. Nations can do whatever they want on their own land.  
The Fed acted within these guidelines, and they have our full support.  
  
The CC's actions as newfriends were completely understandable and we support their efforts to get established, and not be pushed around by aggressive strangers. We would have acted the same way had we been in their shoes, and they have our full support.  
  
When you can see the right in both sides of an issue you bring those sides together and find an amicable solution. That is what sharp and rob did tonight.  
  
Wyck enjoys a very good relationship with Rev State. They are our strongest military ally. The people of Wyck would gladly fight and die on the walls of Rev State if they had need of us, and they feel the same way about us, or so Twitch tells us ;) Wyck has the complete support of Rev State in what we are doing and saying here tonight.  
  
Wyck is forming a military alliance with The Federation and the Cocoa Conglomerate, and where Wyck goes Rev State goes (and visa versa Rev, we &lt;3 you). Any aggressive action taken against any alliance member will result in the immediate response of all member nations (with the exception of CC, you guys just worry about building your nation).  
  
Wyck fails to recognize any legitimacy to Omnitopia's demands or threats, based solely on one man's dislike of how a sovereign state acted within its own borders. I'll let Sharp decide how he wants to handle the de-escalation with Omni and getting Luni to retract his threats.  
  
The Fed and CC squashed their issues and are now friends, with each other and Wyck. Stop beating your war drum, we settled this like adults.

Already it caused many valuable members of this community to lose interest in the server, including one of the arguably most interesting nations we have yet seen, The Angstrom Dynasty, who in the past widely contributed to the overarching culture of the server and is now but a shell of what it used to be.

Now The Federation is recklessly antagonizing the newest members we have acquired from our latest promotion efforts at /r/worldbuilding a far more valuable commodity than a group of unpopular and hardheaded players most here would rather do without.

So you see I have a proposal for the Federation. You are to release the pearled players immediately, grant them ownership and sovereignty over the small piece of land that intersects with your claims and which was not even in use prior to their coming. You will then allow free passage of your rivers, disbanding the toll and refrain from further antagonizing any other players. 

In return this conflict will be halted and I shall personally donate a half stack of diamond blocks to The Federation, provided it follows these guidelines presently and into the future.

Should you comply, there shall be peace and all will be well.

Should you refuse however, you will find the Omni-Alliance will place heavy bounties on the heads of the members of The Federation. I'm thinking a stack of diamond blocks per member should suffice.

If instead you foolishly choose to escalate this conflict rather than adopting the proposed peaceful resolution, the Omni-Alliance will declare war on The Federation. This is the largest alliance of nations in the server, comprising a majority of the most powerful civilizations in this server, and doubtless many others would also join who are not quite fond of the Federation and their methods.

I pray you will be reasonable and avoid unnecessary conflicts while there is still a chance. If not, you will find us more than capable to take you on and it likely would not end well for The Federation.

Thank you for your time.

* I fucked sharp over and figured I could make it up to him by perhaps help capture some guy he wanted pearld.

* Idk man I'm random

These are all acceptable answers from me, and are all true.

I thought the server agreed with pearling him, as it seemed that Robby was being rather aggressive with the ""you can't back these claims"" thing, or whatever. So I decided, eh what the hell why not.
I literally have tons of PVP stuff laying around collecting dust, so why not go help sharp?

Manipulating people is a shitty thing to do, I get that. ...But I'm good at it. And luni, from what it seems, you do it fairly often too.
If you're good at something, and it's useful to making a job go faster, why not, eh?

I realize that makes me sound like a huge dick, let alone untrustworthy, but it's true.  
Do your homework, people. If you seem to be on the run from two people, it's not best to go hang out with a guy with a history of manipulating fugitives.

When I saw what Robby really wanted I felt like shit, so I got out of bed and went to rescue him from my own stupidity. First of all, why the hell am I helping Sharp, the dudes a dick to me. Second of all, this Robby guy seems alright. Which he seemed like a great guy the entire time, which made me feel like shit anyway, but a jobs a job.

I logged on and went to The Federation and got Robby's pearl and trekked on foot to Rev-State. Probably the safest place for him at the moment. I crafted him diamond armor, and some tools, and I'm awaiting him to log on so I can free him and supply him with some gear.

Currently, we are in the End, justifiably or not justifiably, it is your own to say. Take this as a tale of not injustice, glory, freedom or inevitable doom but as a story of dream. Dreams that followed the path Lady Fate took her on. Let us begin.

**THE ACTION/DRAMA/ADVENTURE IS IN ACTS II AND III**

** *Act I: A New World* **

**Day 1:** I woke up on the broken beach. Looked grieved, destroyed and more. Died. Woke up in a swamp. Died. Woke up in the tundra. Died. Woke up in a plains, lived.

**Day 2:** My friend Awolz_bro has joined me. After a similar Day 1 process, he wakes up in a field as well, not too far. After traveling for an hour, we meet up in his hidey hole somewhere north east of the mountains of the Amani. We make our way to the Great Lake and dug a hole and get off for the night. 

Me and Awolz_bro spent the rest of the night looking at the map and sub. So curious of the world and its jewels. Imagining going to places like Moria, the isolated nation in the tundra, or Sky Utopia, the steam punk city hidden in the clouds to the east or the Revolution State with their high walls and the many ships built in the north west. We decided the following weekend we would go on a ""Continental Tour"" to visit all the wonderful places. 

**Day 3:** We decide we should start heading southwest. We spotted this place at  the end of a river junction in the Jungles to the southwest on the map, we could settle there we figured. We are messaged by a member of the Amani Kingdom. He suggested we explore the civilizations there that they were abandoned. We go up the river from the Great Lake to Greyshore. Low on food, we took some wheat and replanted, paying back for what we took. We then proceeded to go through the southwest river to the water channel. We took that all the way down into Angstrom. The mill was the first thing I remember seeing, looking at the wonderful stone structure on top of the hill and being in awe. The building to the base of the hill, which we assumed was a bank upon further inspection, was also eye candy. The birch wood, planks and stone made it look so elegant. Sadly, it was partially raided and the ""bank vault"" with a 6 digit pin was opened and only a mine was on the other side. We left, and looked around for supplies. We found a wheat field partially full, and repeated the take and replant process.

Afterwards, we went down the river. Along the edge of the river we encountered a very odd building. It looked like some wooden dojo, but incomplete it seemed from afar. Upon further investigation, we assumed someone sent flame to it yet, not enough to burn it completely. A small house resided next to it and a field of wheat, in the shape of a terrace farm along a hill going down unto the river. The dojo was the one building that still impacts me the greatest out of all the things we saw. It was a symbol of what we strive to meet- dream. Whoever once owned it is probably long gone, maybe they left because they resettled, or they were attacked, or maybe just out of boredom. Regardless, it represented the once before land time has claimed.

Going down the river further, we hit a large wall and toll booth marked ""The Federation Toll Booth"", connected to impressively built walls. Not seeing anyone and going off the advice they had been abandoned from our friend, we searched around. The place was similar to Angstrom for it was very incomplete and looked like some parts of their walls were grieved and their chests and enchanting table were out in the open. No large structured were there besides some very block like jungle wood buildings and small stone buidlings, we found 2 pieces of badly damaged gear, a little bit of food and a stack of stone. Grateful they were unprotected, we were able to prosper from it greatly. 

We decided to leave afterwards and continue south of the river. One noticeable thing as we went down was less signs of activity. All along the Greyshore river and Angstrom to Federation stretch there were buildings or structures, like small homes or in the instance of Angstrom to Federation the Dojo. This was different. We saw some torches on the edges and an attempt at 2 to settle on the edge but they seemed to have failed. We arrived at another fork in the river and found a small home. Inside was a chest, filled with food. We assumed this was some half way travel home, where one could stay the night and rest. Instead of resting, we deposited extra bread and took a left at the fork, remembering from the map it ended in the middle of the jungle.

Arriving at the end of that small river with again, no attempts of life on the edges, we knew this is where we would settle. All that was there was a double chest with a bunch of gravel and few stacks of cobblestone. Also, a weird diamond shaped cut into the ground about 15 blocks wide all around and 15 blocks deep. Like before, we assumed this was abandoned and ended the night there.


**Day 4:** We begin construction of a temple, wanting to go with a Mayan/Incan theme to our little nation. I finished with the outline and we convinced our friends, HPZ and Jbej, to come. Comparing coords with the beach and our own, we realized spawn was about 15 minutes down further the river and on the edge of the bay. I went to go pick up our friends and we returned, working on the temple and a farm. We decided to be called the Cocoa Conglomerate. 

I receive a message about 30 minutes after picking up our friends from a ""Sharpcastle33"". The message said ""You're fucking dead kid."" Confused, I told him what and you may be messaging the wrong person. Nope. Supposedly the Federation our friends said was abandoned was not. They wanted to bloodthirsty revenge and I told them we would pay for the damage done. I received no message in return and they logged out.

**Day 5:** More progress on the temple, it is nearly complete and we rendezvous with our fifth friend. We come up with a plan to go on our Continental Tour tomorrow, and trade our Cocoa we farmed with everyone we met. Our Mayan temple was nearly complete. Myself, Awolz, and our fifth friend, Binita, decide to go show him up the river the Federation and Angstrom. Remembering how the Federation was mad at us, we decided to go around via land and back to the river at their booth. As we go up he sees the unkept Dojo as well. His reaction was he vowed to return and restore the place, to what it was meant to be. He too, felt the haunting presence of a dream left to ruin. 

Once we reached Angstrom, I began to wonder. What *happened* to the land here? We did see a building or two that was grieved but not so many and so clumped like here. Also, not on such a scale as Angstorm. The water channel represented the tunnel between the northern world of many great civilizations undiscovered by us and our own, of an abandoned, ruined world filled with mystery and history. We went back home and quit for the night.

The Federation yet to message me again.

**Day 6:** It's Friday, aka the weekend, and we finally finished the [Temple](http://imgur.com/DkDom5l) and all it's glory. Our other two friends didn't join us that day and we decided, Awolz, Binita and myself, to begin our continental tour by exploring the Northwest. 

Before we left, we visited our Amani Kingdom friends and Awolz helped them move some donkeys through the jungle which one supposedly blew up. RIP. They were kind and gave us leather armor and food for all. 

From Amani, went to Greyshore and instead of going towards the Great Lake, we went up towards the Revolution State, a supposedly hostile one according to our Amani friends nearby. We asked permission to enter since we knew they were one of the larger civilizations and someone replied yes. We entered and were *astonished*. Only someone in creative could build this we thought. They were of a 1800s coastal city of the sorts, heavily made of a dark oak wood and stone brick with massive stonebrick walls enforced by logs surrounding the place. We met the builder of these great structures as we went through, his name Twitchingtonz. We complimented the place and he said we'd be welcome back anytime. We continued upstream and hit Aicchu, a civilization at the end of the river on a delta feeding into the sea. The buildings looked as if they were of a modern design, minimalist but stylish. We headed northwest through a swamp and landed on a Nether island, where I would quickly meet my end via a lava pool. That ended our day as I re spawned in a mountainous, mesa biome, headed east went home with everyone and submitted the finish temple onto the subreddit. 

Once more the Federation has yet to message us.

Macrat7 was one of the best friends I made on this server. We'd sit in teamspeak for hours and talk. I'd occasionally come to Brandenburg to help defend it when raiders were online, and in turn he'd hang out with me in Rev-State some times.

Recently I told him that **IF** Pyongyang was as strong as the Federation, that we'd probably be at war by now. I don't remember why I said that, but I believe it had something to do with Mac turning brandenburg over to Wyck, WHO I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH. I guess Mac told sharp or something, and now sharp thinks I want war.

Reasons why I will not go to war with the Federation:

* They outnumber Pyongyang

* They are allied with Wyck, and I like Wyck.

* I'd rather build Pyongyang rather than watch it burn

* I'd rather just test my nuclear capabilities, not have to use them \/s

At that time the server was still quite small and so was the community. Since then we have grown a lot bigger with a lot more people playing daily, so I want to try this idea again. 

For the first Championship I need 16 people to participate, if a lot of people are interested I'll see about increasing the amount of places in future events.

To enter the competition, comment below with your IGN and I will write your name down on the list. Places are first come, first serve, so please apply as soon as possible if you want in.

This event has **no restrictions on armour or weapons**, fully enchanted diamond armour is allowed and you may use any weapons you like, Potions are allowed with the exception of Harming Potions - They are too OP. Any gear you lose when you die becomes your opponent's spoils of battle, unless they decide to give it back to you. **No pearling players.**

It will cost 10 Diamonds to enter, anyone who wants to come and watch the fights can stay free of charge.

The winner of the tournament will receive **1 month of Reddit Gold** and 10 Diamond Blocks, while the runner up receives 5 Diamond Blocks and a pat on the back.

Hope to see you there!

&amp;nbsp;

The Great Race of CivilEx I call it. Basically you start from a set point in the map and you need to reach a destination in the shortest possible time.

&amp;nbsp;

Any means of transportation are allowed (except /tp, looking at you Phaxar). Boats, minecarts, horses, sprinting, you name it. As long as you make it to the destination. Planning your route is part of the fun!

&amp;nbsp;

All members of every nation are welcome. There are no limits on participants or entrance fees of any kind. I will not be participating myself, only overseeing the event and delivering prizes for the fastest contestants.

&amp;nbsp;

The start and finish locations will be announced several hours before the event starts. You must make it to the start before the race begins on your own and stand by for the event to commence. From there you have **two hours** to reach the announced destination however you want. The event will be held soon, likely within the week. If you have a time preference, please state it (GMT please), as I'll try and accommodate it so most people can join.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

There will be **prizes** for everyone participating of course. You get to claim a prize from the pile as soon as you cross the finish line, so get there first if you want to choose before everyone else! Don't worry, even if you don't make it in the leading positions, you'll still get a nice consolation prize!

&amp;nbsp;

- Beacon (Available: 2)
- A fast mule (12+ speed). (Available: 3)
- Name Tag + 5 Leads + 2 Saddles + Gold Horse Armor (Available: 3)

&amp;nbsp;

The grand winner will also have **a statue made of his/her likeness** to preserve the memory of their prowess for posteriority at a Hall of Fame to be built in a central location in the world.

&amp;nbsp;

If you'd like to participate please confirm it in this thread, so I can have a general idea of how many people will be participating. If the event proves a success I intend to hold several editions of it across the month, always changing the origin and destination as well as considering new prizes.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your time and I hope you have fun!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A couple of things we need to cover real quick to get everyone up to speed. First, it seems like some people are starting to figure out our whole ""enslave this entire server"" plot, which is mind boggling because I feel like we've done a pretty good job of pretending to only be interested in being a productive member of this Civ and focusing on building and having fun.  
  
It's come to my attention, through many of our spies abroad (people seem to forget all winds blow to Wyck) that our plot to invade the great north has been leaked. Our diamond runs, the ones that never bring us closer to Moria than a thousand blocks, are only yielding thousands of diamonds and I want millions of diamonds. I know some of you thought it a little foolish to plan to attack one of the larger nations drowning in diamonds at the opposite end of the world, but I see no better way to be slightly colder than we are on top of Wyck. We all know how the desert heat effects our cold hardened hearts.  
  
Next issue - these sheep's clothing we had made for us. I don't know who was in charge of having these outfits sewn but clearly the stitches are failing and our wolf hair is poking out all over the place. Plus, it doesn't matter how good a disguise these are, our giant wolf fangs are still super obvious every time we talk. People would have to be blind to think we were actually sheep. I want the name of whoever we put in charge of having these sheep's clothing created so I can hang them by their toes from the walls of Wyck.  
  
Next issue - Brandenburg. I know what you're thinking. If we were going to wage war in the north why wouldn't we keep a massive chunk of land and use it as a forward military base, and force Mac to stay there all alone so it didn't seem abandoned. Better yet, why wouldn't we just not make any announcement about Brandenburg and just spring a sneak attack from the city once we were ready. To be honest, i'm not sure. I keep having thoughts of a half naked sheep woman and it's making it hard to remain focused. At the time I thought welcoming an active player to Wyck and giving back a massive chunk of unused land to the community, while protecting the builds and chests of players who might come back , was the perfect way to lull the server into thinking we were just accepting a player who wanted to join us and figuring out the best way to handle his land without senselessly, and needlessly, adding it to Wyck's claim, just so we could look big and important. Apparently they saw through this devious plan, just like all our devious plans.  
  
Speaking of half naked sheep women. The FemBots are almost complete. When they are we will lure the residents of Brandywine back to Wyck, get them drunk, and imprison them. Then we will replace them with the FemBots and Brandywine, like so many other nations already, will merely be a puppet state for Wyck. Let's be honest, nothing is more fun in MC than a server full of slaves and people who hate you. We're so close.  
  
Lastly, our alliance with The Fed continues to be a topic of debate and confusion. ""Why would Wyck ally with a nation of cannibals and devil worshipers if they didn't have some devious master plan???"" Here's what I like about The Fed - they're honest. They don't have two faces, just one face, and yes it's a face a lot of other nations don't like, but at least they're honest about who they are. They like the PvP aspect of Civ, they like protecting their borders, and they have their own way of doing it that they are unapologetic about. They do things their own way, inside their own borders. They don't lie to people to lure them to what they think is a safe meeting, only to betray them and pearl them. They don't threaten other sovereign states with war if they don't behave how The Fed demands they behave within their own borders. Also, this is a Civ server. Wars and PvP are inevitable whether its wildcards like Nerd_Chops starting a war, or griefers coming though in force, or an actual legit nation war. Wyck is here for the full experience. We enjoy and expect to engage in all aspects of the Civ experience - city development, trade relations, and war. If we wanted a PvPless server we could have found one. While we don't go looking for fights we're clearly interested in standing up for what we feel is right when we feel like someone else is being unfairly treated, and sometimes that results in conflict. All that being said, The Fed is the largest, most active, most skilled PvP nation on this server and they have a fairly isolationist approach to the game. If a fight breaks out, or a war begins, we're going to count ourselves lucky The Fed are fighting alongside us. Yes, they could use a little more gentleness to their approach, but our hope is to help make them a little more diplomatic. The server has already tried the hate train approach to handling The Fed and it clearly hasn't worked. Wyck has a different approach, and so far we feel like its working.  
  
If one of you figures out how to send group PMs on here let me know so I can take this down before someone not in Wyck reads this.

&gt;Brandenburg has chosen to leave the protection of Nexus and dissolve its Protectorate status under Nexus. Brandenburg thanks Nexus for their help and wishes them the best in their future endeavors.  
  
&gt;As the leader of Brandenburg I believe this nation is poorly located in the mountains, and our lack of natural resources (minus emeralds), and decline in population have lead to me take the following actions.  
  
&gt;I, Macrat7, am renouncing my claims to the Administrative Republic of Brandenburg and hand over ownership of all Brandenburg lands and claims to the nation of Wyck.  
  
Macrat7 approached me about joining Wyck. He is the leader and sole resident of Brandenburg and wishes to be part a part of a larger community. Macrat7 has been hanging out in our TS server and we've had a chance to get to know him. Even though he doesn't meet our normal recruitment requirements we have welcomed him to Wyck and look forward to having him atop the Mountain with us.  
  
Brandenburg is still full of history, buildings, and belongings of players who may or may not return to the server from time to time. For this reason we do not want to completely abandon the Nation or the City to the wild. We have created a modest cobble fence perimeter to the city limits and will be shrinking the Brandenburg claim down to what will become the Historic City of Brandenburg, only as large as necessary to encompass existing buildings.  
  
The revised claim will be drawn and posted once the perimter fence is done. The remainder of Brandenburg's land will be unclaimed at that point and returned to wilderness, awaiting some future peoples to come and claim it.  
  
The city of Historic Brandenburg will become Wyckish land and any destructive or hostile actions taken within the city limits will be treated as an assault on the Wyckish homeland.  
  
Any questions are welcome. Thanks for reading!

I haven't been on the server as much as I'd have liked lately but I'd like to run an idea by you all: Who'd be interested in establishing a CivilEx Road Crew with me? 

As much as I like rails, they're quite dull and don't match the feeling of riding across the world on horseback. Given that a lot of the terrain out there is still quite hostile to overland travel, a road system would simplify things.

A lot of the early states over at /r/Civcraft were built on the backs of the road crews, who worked tirelessly to build and maintain the international highway system, which brought with them trade and increased activity.

The main rules of the network would be as follows (keep in mind these are just basic, rushed rules so bear with me):

* 1) All international roads must take routes that disrupt the natural landscape as little as possible. Ploughing straight through a mountain or a hill is the easy way out, a winding path might take a little more time to travel but works better aesthetically.

* 2) International roads must be well-lit and made from a uniform design with no 90^^^o hard corners (design pending). They can be colour coded with stained clay or wool but other than that they have to look identical.

* 3) The road network is opt-in; a state must agree to have a road hooked up before one is built. However, consent is a contract and allows road crew members free access to the land required to do their job. The consenting state will nominate an Entry/Exit point for the highway. Consent cannot be retracted.

* 4) Upon completion a state may modify highway portions within their claims as they see fit, provided members of the road crew are notified about the works beforehand and the design of the road itself is not modified.

In order to accurately build the roads, the Road Crew will go through a three stage process:

* 1) Surveying. Road crew members will travel between the two entry/exit points and place markers down at points that the road will follow.

* 2) Construction. Once a route is determined, the road itself will be built.

* 3) Modifying. Lamposts, signposts, tree chopping, railing, colour coding and any other required small tasks will be completed to ensure the safety and ease of navigation on the roads.

That's about all there is to say at the moment. I'll be modifying this post throughout the next few days to form a better idea about what a road crew would actually look like.

But I digress.

A friend of mine was already playing on this server with his girlfriend, kinda just roaming around, I believe, so I figured I'd give it a try as well. First thing that happened was me taking damage. Ouch! Oh, it's some kind of weather mod, alright. Apparently getting armor helps against this and I don't plan on sitting in this makeshift dirt hut forever, so I might as well get a move on. Which is how I got to Barleywine.

Now, I've never played Minecraft in PvP or online in any kind that wasn't just with close friends, but I've heard stuff about the toxicity and little kiddies that would roam around. I half expected to just end up with a sword in my face, having to respawn in some random spot again. Still, I haven't actually got anything of value at this point, so might as well take my chances. Instead of a swift death, I get a tour of an incredibly cute little town, a set of leather armor to protect myself from the elements, and a bottle of Real Barleywine Absinth™. Allissonn (forgive me if I don't get the amount of letters in your name right), I thank you for this. I take my leave north, towards my friend who's mining there.

After some searching, I find the entrance to my friend's ""mine"". We start digging, finding some diamond, some iron, some emerald, all that good northern stuff (so I heard). At a certain moment, the friend had to leave, but not before we found a natural cave. With several tunnels coming from it. My friend left, and I decided to investigate. After a long struggle of trying not to move in circles again and again, I encounter LionHeart of Moria, and once again I am welcomed with open arms. Once again I get a tour, once again I am fed and equipped. Then, as King Bouer rode into Moria on his mighty steed (**cough** logged in **cough**), his horse tripped (**cough** he fell down a ledge **cough**) and he dropped all his magnificent equipment.

Day 3

Recieved confirmation that this is not a toll and continued onwards. I am now getting into the deltas. The sea air is warm and balmy, and it brings a smile to my face. I haven't seen the ocean in a long while. Despite coming from a land with little to no water, I do feel a certain kinsmanship. No one can hold back the sea, and I am free in the same way.

What utter tripe.

I weathered the night at the Survival Union, talking with one of the natives, Spawn_Point. They seemed friendly enough, even if not so chatty.

All in all, a short day. Nothing but sand and water to be seen.

Day 4

Was surprised to hear word of my partner coming to join me! Needless to say, I was excited. Travelling is better in twos. Also caught wind of someone else possibly joining our troupe in the future. Fantastic! The more the merrier.

Anticipating Candle's arrival, I head back upstream a bit to meet them. A bit of time wasted, but we're in no rush. Weathered the night again at the not-toll, much happier for the company. 

Day 5

We set out to catch back up just before dawn, making it back to the Union before noon. From there we continued forward through the trees.

Candle and I have been friends for almost two years now, so the conversation came easy. We joked and talked politics, both of us in agreement on recent issues with the Federation between other nations. Given their ailing eyesight, it was necessary to help them across the treetops at times, taking their hand to guide them to safer branches and pull them over the gaps. It hardly seemed any time had passed by the time we stumbled upon one of the sea forts.

I'll be the first to admit that we haven't exactly been paying attention to the maps. For the most part our path meandered through the land, wandering off in directions to investigate ruins and other things as we saw fit. Our only general rule of navigation thus far has been to keep the coast to our left.

Seeing the fort, however, I did bring up the maps. I recalled seeing it on there, but not the name. Unfortunately, the maps yielded no better information, the name on our copy being too small and blurred to make out. Nonetheless, we did our share of poking around, commenting on the lovely design of the place to each other and left. We settled in for the night not but fifty or sixty yards away, caught unawares by the sunset. By moonlight I took advantage of having my journal back (much thanks to Candle), and [sketched out the sights of the day.](http://imgur.com/aQaRA8X)",12,CivilizatonExperiment,,2738,12,,

New [terms of peace](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2wa8gp/a_proposition_for_peace_from_the_omnialliance/) have been signed between the Omni-Alliance and the Federation. As of these moment all hostility between the nations involved are to cease completely.

As the first major conflict to break out in the server involving several nations, we learned much of the strengths of each nation and we pushed the limits of the server itself, with a period of unparalleled activity which required the player caps to be raised.

Omnitopia would like to extend its thanks to all the nations who pledged their members to our cause. We believe the war, though unintended, served it's purpose. Peace reigns once more and we're better for it. 

We'd like to remind you, as per the agreed terms, any nations wishing to have snitches removed from their lands must notify Federation customer service within 5 days. 

On behalf of the Omni-Alliance, I'd like to ask all the nations involved in the conflict to donate as many basic resources as they can possibly spare for the reconstruction of the Federation. These include chests of cobblestone, stone, sand and wood and well as stacks of wool, paper, iron and such. As well as crops, preferably the sort that can be harvested such as potatoes, carrots and nether wart. 

Omnitopia will be donating the following, to make amends for any ill-will caused by the conflict:

- A stack of diamond blocks
- A stack of emerald blocks
- An enchanting table
- A beacon
- A Fortune III Pick + Silk Touch Pick
- A copy of Akn's brewing book (Provided she doesn't sue me for copyright violation)

We hope any dealings with the members of The Federation and Wyck can be accomplished through diplomacy and peaceful talks, and that no further conflicts are necessary.

World War I is over.

We are on the verge of peace, which is why I notified Luni and bouer before coming to reddit. We are not interested in a new conflict, or any conflict, but Wyck cannot allow Delnor to settle in the desert.  
  
Here is why.  
  
Delnor threatened war on Pyongyang because they failed to properly vet existing claims. Pyongyang eventually, through a rare act of reason on Nerd's part ;), secured a peaceful agreement to a redrawing of claim lines and a brief alliance was announced between Pyongyang, Delnor, Sky Utopia, and others.  
 
Shortly after this, Delnor reached out to Sharp about joining the Wyck-Fed Alliance. Their reason was that they didn't feel safe. The claimed that the alliance had been abolished immediately after it had been announced. Sharp told them they had to talk to me first. We invited Tropic33 to join us on TeamSpeak, which he did, and we discussed them joining our Alliance. To be clear, they courted us, not the other way around. We made it clear that they didn't have to fight in any war and that we would bring them supplies, like we do for all our allies. They agreed to all of this and left Teamspeak.  
  
Three hours later Delnor joined the Coalition and attacked The Federation. It's a bizarre act of betrayal and a completely unnecessary one. We don't mind that they fought against us, but courting us and seemingly joining our alliance gained them nothing, no secret info or war strategy, all it accomplished was a loss of respect for Delnor on our part. It was a weird, and honor-less act.  
  
The next day they complained on reddit, multiple times, that they weren't mentioned when nations were listed as participating in the attack on The Fed. That night, when The Fed were actually on and pearling people left and right, Delnor took the time to make a post stating that they were fleeing their homeland. A nation far away from the conflict, with no immediate threat to themselves or their city, but they chose to run. Perhaps because they thought The Feds might storm Pyongyang, and they didn't want to be targeted. But all that would show would be their unwillingness to stand and defend people whom they had ridden with the night before.  
  
They have since attempted to claim more claimed land, the Golden Horde. Packers wasn't interested, so they have attempted to settle directly north of Wyck.  
  
Their actions are hard to decipher, dishonorable, and unacceptable. Wyck objects to their attempt to settle anywhere in the desert. This is supposed to be a time of peace and rebuilding, and we don't feel comfortable with them being so close. It's antagonizing, and as we have already made clear, we will not be antagonized. They have had invites to join northern nations, or settle in the north of the map. We think that is best. We hope they choose to continue their diaspora and eventually settle up north where they are welcome.  
  
I'm PMing this to all of their members and asking that they comment here and let us all know that they will find somewhere else to live. Thank you.",15,CivilizatonExperiment,,3156,17,Announcement,announcement

With these changes to the rule, we are going to add multiple things to the server:
 
* **Citadel reinforcements will be doubled.**
 * Sadly all reinforced blocks have to be reinforced by the players themselves, since the plugin doesn't update the reinforcements automatically.
 
* **Enderchests will be enabled with 6 slots** of capacity.
 * You won't be able to put pearls in an enderchest.

Initially this looked to be a positive, but as relations between the Wyck-Fed alliance and Omnitopia/Pyongyang deteriorated we found ourselves thrust into a war which we neither instigated nor wished to entangle ourselves in as a nation. We are a peaceful country who wishes nothing but progress through mutual co-operation with our allies, not through blood and steel.

In light of this conflict, it has been decided by general consensus that to avoid future problems of this nature **Sky Utopia will be leaving the Omni-alliance.** *Any actions taken during a time of war by a citizen of Sky Utopia will be considered an act of their own free will and not a formal action by the Sky Utopian administration, unless in direct defence of the homeland.*

This does not affect the Skavarian alliance, which will remain in force as will any pre-existing trade or diplomatic relations between Sky Utopia and any other nation.",8,CivilizatonExperiment,,1091,18,,

To start, me and Macrat7 have been having our differences the past few days, but I hold true to my loyalties. I made a promise to mac to defend Brandenburg when it was in danger, and there I was. 

Twitchingtons, Lowridinghobbit, Phaxar, and I gathered and went to Greyshore. Greyshore is just west of G.A.T, so getting there wasn't the issue - we just didn't know what was in store. I got a message about 5 people griefing and raiding Brandenburg, I was pretty spooked. For all I know I was about to get pearled and lose everything I had just gotten, thank god that wasn't the case. 

Phaxar and I got to G.A.T before everyone else, and we ambushed Intact_Agent, and DigitallHero. [I pearled both of them](http://imgur.com/a/TP6Sg), and we went to Greyshore after fhillip (another griefer with G.A.T) When we got there it was too late; fhillip had escaped southwest-bound. I messaged Dovah on skype to log on, due to the fact he logged off near the Federation, so I knew he could help get fhillip. Mac excitedly remembers that the Federation had snitched the waterway to Angstrom, and Sharp is relaying us coordinates to Fhillip.

Fhillip escapes the reach of Sharp's elaborate snitch network, and heads North East (as far as we know.)  
I almost kill Grybryant(However the heck you say his name)
but he escapes via boat when I had about one hit left to kill him :/

###You shouldn't found a new nation instantly.
Before starting a new nation, take a look if there already are nations with the same ideas and principles as you. Check [**this post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2ujitu/civilex_player_directory/) for a list of players and a link to their nation's subreddit.

###Why shouldn't I found a new nation?
In the history of CivEx, a lot of nations have been founded. Only a fraction of those are still active to this date. Many nations exist for a few weeks and then slowly disappear. This leaves a dead town and unused but claimed land. 

###What are the benefits of joining an existing nation?
By joining an existing nation you get a big number of benefits:

* Access to materials that have already been gathered
* Useful gear
* Farms
* A place to live
* Protection from possible alliances
* Help from other citizens

We saw what a large number of motivated players can accomplish. For all the trouble it caused, it breathed new life in this server. Player caps had to be raised. The subreddit has never been this active. The most popular thread in the subreddit was born yesterday.

A lot has happened. People got killed, left and right, on both sides. Pearls were collected and released. We've had our share of CoolPVP. Possessions were looted. People went overboard and took out their frustration on the Federation by needlessly destroying builds.

I say, enough is enough. This war has since devolved into anarchy. It's time we reach a peaceful solution.

These are our terms for the Federation. [I've ran a preliminar version by Sharpcastle33](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2w9l4p/server_down/coow51t) and he agreed they are reasonable enough. I personally believe they are fair, and should they be accepted, we will sue for peace and hopefully end the war without further bloodshed.

Terms for Peace:
---

The Federation will cease installing snitches in foreign lands that they do not control, without the express permission of the leader(s) of the nations. This also extends to private railways and other infrastructures, unless allowed by the creator of said builds. Public infrastructures should be fair game, as far as I'm concerned.

Any nations that had snitches placed in their lands without permission should be able to request the snitches removed. Most people are not comfortable being under surveillance at all times. We ask that the Federation agree to remove snitches they might have placed in the lands or buildings of anyone who asks them to.

We ask also that any threats to forcefully annex Omnitopia lands, or indeed, the lands of any other nations are suspended. We are not willing to part with Omni Alpha, because as previously mentioned, we have used it for nearly four months and have extensive infrastructure developed there. 

In a gesture of good faith, we will be donating Omni Omega, the westernmost island to Wyck. Ownership will be transferred once peace is instated, and likely they would not find issue with the Federation, as former allies, to use those lands. It must be noted that the request for the dissolution of the alliance between the Federation and Wyck was in regards to a military alliance. No trade embargoes were instated. Wyck is free to trade with the Federation as they like.

Finally, we request that The Federation considers relaxing their internal policies on trespassers. No other nations make a big deal of people simply walking through their claims. As it stands, most people in the server either actively avoid Federation lands or pass through it with apprehension. Likewise, we would like to see the toll through their lands suspended. Realistically, I believe this has caused much more trouble than gain to the Federation. Not enough people pass through those lands with regularity for the toll to become a stable source of income, and the drama instigated by this decision has so far caused nothing but problems to the Federation.

In return, we request that the nations of the Omni-Alliance, Pyongyang and any other nations involved in the conflict donate as much basic resources as they can to the Federation, in order to aid in reconstruction purposes and to make up for possible griefing and the loss of all their chests. These include chests or stacks of cobblestone, stone, wood, iron, bricks, sand, etc. Any other nations, who were not involved in the conflict but still would like to aid in their recovery are free to help.

Should these terms be accepted, I will order the Omni-Alliance to suspend further aggression on the Federation. We expect all pearled people to be released. The contract with Ares will be terminated, and they will be paid an undisclosed sum for services rendered. The war ends.

I pray the Federation finds these terms reasonable, and we can put an end to this conflict and come out on top, having brought a withering server back to life.

Thank you all for your attention

It seems like this conflict is more about trying to permapearl Federation members then it is actually doing anything productive. They pearled a mercenary, so you guys ran into their base, popped all their chests, griefed the shit out of it, possibly xrayed their valuables, all while they were offline.

 I used to think that this was a server where everyone is trying to make the world civilized. The Fed has already made it clear that they will not grief and that their pearls will be three days long. 

Typically I'm not one to say this, but it seems that Co. is worse than the Fed.

I went from Brandenburg to Rev State and was heading south when I logged out. Right around then was when war was declared and things were just starting to heat up. I haven't logged back in for fear of logging back in inside of a war zone, and thus I apologize upfront if I misinterpret some information.

From what I've read on the subreddit, however, I see that there is no real laws of war, however, war is a mess filled with griefing, chest-popping, and pearling with no limit to the incivility of some members of the war. I think that this war shows that we need some laws of war, if there aren't any already. Again, I am somewhat uninformed of the war, so I apologize if I misinterpret information.

## My Proposal:

We should have Laws of War that govern what counts as war, and what counts as senseless brutality.

**Law I:** Declaration of war.

I can foresee, in the future of CivEx, spontaneous attacking from one nation to another. This is my proposition: 

*Any act of hostility between two nations must be preceded by a declaration of war or a set of terms which, if not followed, will result in a declaration of war.*

**Law II:** Military Justification.

I feel this is the largest problem in the war. Whole nations are being destroyed, with the excuse being war. Here's what I propose:

*Any damage caused to property of a nation must be proportional to the war being fought and not excessive in relation to the nation's ability to defend itself at that moment.*

**Law III:** The White Flag.

I know that there is no literal white flag in Minecraft or CivEx, but the white flag is generally known as a symbol of peace, communication or surrender. This is something I propose:

*If a nation wishes to surrender or communicate with an opposing nation peacefully, they must announce so in an obvious manner. All players under that declaration are not allowed to attack anyone in battle, and in turn, nobody in battle is allowed to attack them.*

---

What other Laws of War should there be? Discuss.

---

The second part of my proclamation are the punishments for violation of the rules.

**The Jury System:**

All parties affected meet at a set time in a teamspeak call, along with chosen members of neutral parties. A judge, likely a moderator, will moderate the teamspeak call and organize a trial. Both parties will have opportunities to explain what happened and why they were in the right. Afterwards, the chosen members of neutral parties will discuss the situation, and come up with and explain a verdict. They will then explain it to the parties involved.

However, if either party feels that they were subject to an unfair or biased case, they can apply for an appeal. The appeal then goes to an appellate court, with another random selection of members from neutral parties. The appellate court is the final verdict on any War Crime.

**The Punishments:**

I'm honestly not sure what punishments a war crime should encompass, however, I am sure that it should not have anything to do with the moderators of the server. It should be something that we, the players, should solve through the form of pearling or other punishments.

---

Again, discuss.

---

**TL;DR** Proposal for Laws of War. Read it, please.

I'm posting it here to keep everything Wyck does on the up and up.  
  
Luni - have you replied to my post?  
Winton - replied to what post? i made an entire post, in which you have commented  
Luni - Essentially, your thread alone is mostly enough confirmation for us (links War - Wyck post)  
Luni - We just want to make sure you are dissolving your alliance with the Federation entirely  
Luni - Do I have your word then that you will no longer support the Federation both in this and future conflicts involving them, and that if we stop this war, you will not go and declare another one at a later date in their support. If you agree with this, your members will be released within the hour  
Winton - we didn't declare war in their support this time, we responded to the merc issue. Regardless, we have dissolved the alliance, and will treat all future conflicts the same way we've done so until now. We've always fought alongside them in fights we thought they were on the right side of.  
Luni - I didn't expect this war to break out this soon. That said, you believed us powerless, and now you see it's not the case.  
Winton - im not sure what that has to do with anything, but yes i'll edit my post  
Luni - We're not likely to seek conflict with any nations other than the Federation. Despite your objections to our methods, we felt like we were doing what was best for the server.  
Winton - but you seek conflict, whereas Wyck responds to hostility  
Luni - Nah, we sought to avoid conflict  
  
The end. Some parts left out since they were due to confusion on my part as to what Luni meant by ""confirmation"".

#The Federation#

**External:**

Pearling Daddo(Ares), a mercenary hired by Omnitopia/Luni, who according to phaxar, the leader of the group, was the battle commander of the group hired ""To pearl Federation/Wyck members."" (However, Luni claims that Ares was hired to protect Omnitopia). This was done inside Greyshore, Daddo's(Ares) place of residence. No griefing was done, no chests were popped. The items Daddo(Ares) had on him were burned.

Declared war on Ares company, and by extension Omnitopia.

War threats on Omnitopia.

Placing snitches in territories without permission and/or in territories where permission was ambigous or claims were disputed. Refusing to remove them themselves. (Omnitopia, Vosis, Rev State)

Pearling CC griefers(HPZ_K0D, jbejmitchell) outside of their claims. 

Dispute with Angstrom over the land The Federation had built on. Bought the land from Angstrom.

**Internal**

Pearling Roshi(Moria). Freed by Feds as their act of good will.

Killing /u/Mega_Dunsparce(Angstrom), as Angstrom has attacked The Fed.

Pearling Issao12(Equinox) and DeathByError(Angstrom), who were stealing from chests in the Federation capitol. Their items were burned. (Freed by Uber(Sanctum), 1 layer DRC vault [Maybe just a warning? Goodwill?])

Refusing to allow players to freely pass through their land without paying a toll, although toll passes have been given to nations such as Amani Kingdom, Avaria, Brandywine, Brandenburg, Wyck, Vaal, and others.

Pearling four bounty hunters in self defense (Not sure how freed, planned 3 days.)

Pearling GetNGoing(Moria) in self defense. (Freed w/ diplomacy. 1 day vaulting?)

Pearling people(Greyshore, Rev State, Rivieria) coming to free Nerd Chops(Rev State) in self defense (Broken out, planned 3 days vaulted.)

Pearling Nerd Chops(Rev State) for attacking The Fed(again). (Given to nexus, freed in 3 days.) 

*armor dispute*

Killing a group of people coming to free Nerd Chops/DBE 

Pearling NerdChops, attacking DBE when they tried to 'annex' the Fed. (3 day pearl?)

*wall dispute*

*buys land from angstrom*

Pearling DBE, when he tried to remove Fed from the lands that they had built on. (freed. 1 layer drc vault)

*claims dispute*

#Omnitopia/Luni

**External**

Only nation other than Ares company who had a Casus Belli to attack the Fed.

Attacked Fed, helped free Daddo(Ares)

Hires Ares company to pearl Federation members. The wording according to Ares company was 32d block/pearl they get, not anything along the lines of ""We will not attack unless they are attacked etc."" 

Attempted to force Fed into giving up land to CC and remove tolls. No Casus Belli AFAIK. Threatened getting allies to declare war.

Withdrew support from Angstrom in the Fed-Angstrom conflict as they believed Angstrom was at that point in the wrong.

#Amani Kingdom

**External**

Declared neutrality in the Fed-CC conflict.

#Moria

**External**

Was part of the Pearl Harbor-esque attack on The Fed to free Daddo. No Casus Belli. Claim that the attack on Omnitopia's allies (Ares Company, the hired mercenaries) was sufficient to go to war.

Said they would be neutral in the Omni-Federation conflict (Not the Fed-CC one), unless they (Omni or Moria?) were attacked.

GetNGoing placed bounty on Darwinism_, Sharpcastle33 after being pearled.

GetNGoing attacked Darwinism_, Sharpcastle33 while being escorted away from the toll. Gets pearled. Apparently thought that he was being handled to harshly.

#Rev State/Pyongyang# *drama drama drama?*

**External:**

Attacked The Federation without a casus belli.

Caused unneeded drama.

Trespassed on federation land multiple times, attempted to avoid snitches by going through the nether.

/u/Nerd_Chops got banned for griefing The Federation randomly after peace treaties we're signed.

Attacked the Federation over a dispute on whether or not Nerd gets his items back after getting pearled by the Federation when he last attacked The Federation.

Members have been part of warbands against The Federation

Attempted to Annex the Federation.

Sided with Angstrom in the Fed-Angstrom conflict. (was this any of their business?)


#Wyck

**External**

See Fed's pearling of Daddo. Wyck was involved here as well.

Declared war on Ares Company, and by extension Omnitopia

#Coalition

**Members:**

Moria

Pyongyang and/or Rev State

Sky Utopia

Vaal

Angstrom

Omnitopia

Ares Company

**Possible Members but unconfirmed:**

Xhakum

Amani Kingdom

**External**

All members went to free Daddo from Fed's vault while most Fed were offline. Killed four Wyck members and one Fed member. According to the Fed, a secret chest buried underground has been popped as well as other chests. Grief has been done as well.

Some members (Ares, Omni) were declared war on by Fed and Wyck for hiring mercenaries who according to their leader to pearl Fed and Wyck members, although Omni swears that they were hired to protect them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will write more later. Feel free to post below anything that you feel should be changed.

If the Feds really are the bad guys, why are they taking the moral high ground?

Fed/Wyck:

&gt;3 day pearl

&gt;No griefing

&gt;Only attacked Mercenaries

&gt;Freed Roshi.

Coalliton:

&gt;~~Unknown pearl time.~~ Edit: Looks like a perma pearl http://prntscr.com/66erfu.

&gt;Massive griefing, as well as chest popping and grief of chests thought to be hidden.

&gt;Retaliated the attack on the mercenaries by rallying and invading the Fed homeland.

&gt;Many members attacked without formally declaring war.

&gt;Freed techsensai.

Last night the admins bumped the server cap from 50 to  75 to accommodate all the people trying to get on. You're welcome ;)  
  
Wyck never wanted a conflict but last night we felt forced to act, as can be read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2w5ads/war/). We received some pretty convincing evidence that Ares Company had been hired, by Omnitopia, to pearl members of Wyck even though we've never acted against Omnitopia in any way. We aren't ones to just sit at home and wait for mercs to come pearl us, so we set out to defend ourselves. Sometimes the best defense is a quick offense.  
  
As it turns out Phaxar misrepresented what he had been hired to do, and by whom he had been hired. I don't think he meant to misrepresent anything, but the words he chose to use in his conversation with Sharp made it seem like he had been hired, by Luni, to hunt members of Wyck, instead of what has now come out, which is that he was hired by the Omni-Alliance (Moria and Omni) to defend them in case of attack.  
  
Either way, you guys assembled a pretty massive army, and even though it didn't get to fight anyone, that kind of response is impossible to ignore. If we had known that Ares Company had been hired as a defensive force we would have continued to go about our business on Wyck.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Wyck is unilaterally backing down from all war efforts. We will not engage in any conflict outside our own borders, or support any nation, militarily or otherwise, that engages in war activities. That includes The Federation. Sharp is fully aware of this decision. We are not condemning The Federation. We are not joining the fight against them. The Federation will work out their own ending to this conflict, on their own terms, and in their own time.  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Wyck's borders are closed for the time being.  
  
P.S. - Thanks for the fun last night. Standing on that wall together as the snitch field went crazy with the invasion force coming towards The Fed was a blast.

&amp;nbsp;


---


As you can see from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2w5ads/war/), Wyck, in an alliance with the Federation, declared war on Omnitopia. They did so based on erroneous information, obtained from an unreliable third party, believing we had hired armed forces to attack them, when in reality their orders were to merely stay alert and bolster our armies. Only should war break were they ordered to pearl the members of the Federation.

Alas, war was declared. Shortly afterwards, we received information a large group of players from the Federation and Wyck were en route to Rev State. At Greyshore, they pearled Daddo69, a member of the Ares company. 

Meanwhile, Omnitopia called their banners. A large group of members from nations of the Omni-Alliance and many more that sympathized with our cause, as well as from Ares, who wished to avenge the fall of their comrade, answered the call. The Fed/Wyck group headed to Revolution State, and not finding anything of note, retreated back to their lands.

Soon after, the newborn *Coalition* of players *fed up* (pun intended) with the Feds joined together in Greyshore to mount an attack and rescue Daddo69. A horde of nearly 30 players in all, from all corners of the server marched in unison. To end the reign of oppression of the Federation.

The vanguard reached Federation lands before the main group. I'm told there were seven players awaiting them there, armed and ready for war. Conflict broke out. People got killed. Our vanguard was 4 people, with nearly 20 coming behind in waves, but it was over so fast I didn't even get to see it.

Six people were pearled. One member of the Federation. Four members of Wyck. And I'm told one other person who was helping defend the Federation but was with neither nation, possibly an innocent bystander caught up in a war foolishly declared. 

A small group, which included myself went to vault the pearls, while the main force stayed to free Daddo69 from the vault his pearl had been placed at. Daddo69 was freed, and I'm told Federation valuables were taken as war spoils. Most of us didn't even get to see battle, though we were ready for it. For all the military prowess our foes were said to possess, our victory in the first battle was swift and efficient.

It was also nearly 30 people versus 7, although the actual battle was 4 on our side, 7 on theirs. Clearly the Federation and Wyck have underestimated the resolve of this server to stand against the tyranny of the Federation.

&amp;nbsp;


**Backstory leading up to the war, for those who missed all the latest drama to hit the subreddit, or aren't entirely clear about it:**

&amp;nbsp;

New members joined the server coming from /r/worldbuilding. They entered Federation territory on the assumption it was abandoned and later moved to a region south of their claims. They build a temple there not knowing they were still violating the claims of the Federation. I need not remind you of all the particulars of this conflict, but it involved the Federation pearling members of the CocoaConglomerate, the Omni-Alliance getting involved trying to prevent the Federation from further harassment by offering a proposal that would dismantle the toll and allow the CocoaConglomerate the lands they were using (backed under threat of war if they refused), and finally Wyck getting involved as well, as they didn't quite agree with our solution and believed they had a better approach.

Wyck took personal offense on my attempt to prevent the Federation from bullying new members and overall acting like jerks to anyone who came close to their lands. They took the current Federation vs CocoaConglomerate conflict in their hands and apparently achieved peace by forming one big alliance. I'm told CC wasn't particularly happy with that arrangement, but they were new and had little choice. [They broke out of this alliance tonight, for reasons they make quite clear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2w5e8f/leaving_the_wyckfederation_alliance_and_neutrality/)

Now backed by Wyck, the Federation grew even more bold in their actions. They decide to start a big snitch network and place snitches on people's nations without their permission. They were called out on it both by Rev. State and Omnitopia who noticed, but they have snitches in most major nations by now. I need not tell you that this equates to essentially being able to spy on people whenever and wherever, so any nation out there should be opposed to foreign entities placing snitches in their lands without permission.

It soon becomes evident the Federation as well as Wyck are interested in acquiring mushroom islands owned by Omnitopia, by force if it takes. We tell them we have one not in use that we would gladly sell, situated very close to Wyck lands, but are not approached regarding this offer.

Rather, the Federation threatens to annex the main island of Omnitopia, Alpha, where we have considerable infrastructure in place, having held and lived there for nearly four months. Visibily upset and fearing an imminent attack, we hire the external Ares Company, overseen by Phaxar, for defense in case the Feds/Wyck attack our lands. They are told they will be paid 32D blocks per pearl of each member of the Feds they acquire, **should war break out**. Phaxar tries to play both sides in order to see who has the better offer, ends up leaking too much information and outright tells Sharpcastle that they will be supporting us, leading them to think we hired them specifically to strike first, which causes Wyck to declare war based on entirely wrong information.

&amp;nbsp;


**Our Demands:**

&amp;nbsp;

**We ask that Wyck backs down on their alliance with the Federation.**

We do not believe the Federation is deserving of the support Wyck has given them. They have done nothing but create problems since they first joined this server and claimed over Angstrom land. No other nation has had anywhere near as many threads complaining about their practices or started as much conflict as the Federation. Wyck seems to believe they are justified in antagonizing new players or essentially doing whatever the hell they want, as long as they're in their lands, nevermind if others suffer for it.

Despite Wyck being the one who declared war and started this conflict, our issue is with the Federation. We have large numbers with us as you have seen. We need not tear the land apart with War.

IN A GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH, WE HAVE RELEASED ONE MEMBER OF WYCK, TECHSENSAI, who we had pearled in the conflict. His pearl was chosen randomly, from all the members of Wyck we had pearled. The other people pearled in the conflict will remain vaulted for the time being until the situation is resolved. This was done in order to encourage Wyck to accept our request of ceasing their alliance with the Federation and abstaining from further involvement in the war.

Should Wyck comply, break their alliance with the Federation and no longer involve themselves in this or any other war siding with the Federation, all their members will be released in good faith. 

Until an appropriate diplomatic solution is found, we remain at war. Nations of the alliance and The Coalition, beware further attacks from Wyck and the Federation, should they continue to prove unreasonable.

Thank you all.

- LunisequiouS,
Chairman of the Omni-Alliance

Edit: The player TheShockinatorV2 was pearled in the conflict and some people have since told me he may not have been with either group, and was just in the wrong place and in the wrong time. 

Again, **in a gesture of good faith**, we have decided to release him, eventhough he stood against us in the conflict. Please, members of neutral nations, if you don't want to be associated with either side, stay clear of any battles until the situation is resolved.",7,CivilizatonExperiment,,7997,15,,

We do **NOT IN ANYWAY POSSIBLE WANT TO START A WAR OR JOIN IN ON ONE BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND GROWING.** Here are the good and bad that's happened because of this alliance.

**The Good**:

* They gave us a decent amount of diamonds as a gift after us leaving.

* They allow us to pilgrim back to our old Temple if we wish (But we haven't after the border mishaps of recent)


**The Bad**: 

* [Here](http://imgur.com/a/JmrZ8) are 8 independent instances of conflict related with the Federation that we don't approve of. 

* Wyck promised us starting supplies after they created the alliance in Teamspeak with ourselves and The Federation. It's been over a week since then and they have yet to send supplies. 

* The Federation has been reported to use snitches in others's civilizations. We don't like NSA spy kinda stuff to begin with. Pls take down. 

* We **did not** consent to being apart of the alliance to begin with. Wyck made us join in order to create peace with The Federation. 


Besides the reasons listed, we don't have any disregard or dislike for Wyck and The Federation. We would love to increase positive relations with them and other nations and we see this is the best way to do this from a foreign stand point. *Please do not see this as an act of war or aggression*. 

Moving on to the next key point, **Neutrality**. The Wardens of Vaal basically want to be the Switzerland of this world. We want to trade with as many people as possible and just grow. We are extremely small and to be honest, **we are not a threat to anyone**. That's why I hope Wyck and The Federation don't see this as an act of aggression but as a chance to grow without political restrictions from alliances.

Wyck has made no aggressive moves or actions towards anyone since we settled on the mountain. The only time we have involved ourselves in international affairs was when we felt like Omnitopia, a nation comprised of one active player for all intents and purposes, was attempting to force another nation to behave within their own borders as he saw fit. We took issue with this and chose to stand up for what we thought was right, The Federation's ability to control their own land and borders, and the Wyck-Federation Alliance was born.  
  
Wyck is not The Fed, and The Fed is not Wyck. We have very different ways of doing things, but we have one thing in common. We fight together.  
  
Omnitopia was once a thriving, populated nation. I've heard they had 20 members, but by the third week of the server all but 4 or 5 had left, and eventually they too left. It's leader, Luni, apparently rubs people the wrong way, because now he's all alone in an otherwise defunct nation.  Omnitopia has claimed a lot of land. Large claims of run-of-the-mill biomes are fine, and typically arise without comoplaint (Golden Horde), even if there isn't an active population (Golden Horde, Omnitopia). The difference with Omnitopia is that they claimed a lot of an extremely rare biome, the mushroom islands. Wyck believes that a nation's claim to its land is only as strong as its ability to defend its borders. Once upon a time Omnitopia was probably very able to protect itself, but at this point it's quite literally 1 person, and 2 players who sign on very rarely. Luni has spoken of leaving the server multiple times, [he's even made goodbye posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2se2wv/and_so_it_ends/), and yet, when active nations like The Fed seek to make use of his rotting land he's suddenly active again and rallying everyone else's members to come to his defense, and wage a war to protect the lands of a defunct and disliked nation. He calls on his Omni-Alliance (this is a military alliance, why is it named after a nation of 1 with no military power) and hires mercenaries to fight his fight for him. Why? So he can continue to grasp on to a dead nation through the deeds of others. No one wants Omnitopia's mainland claim. But the islands are an extremely valuable, and unique facet of this server and an active nation should be making use of them.  
  
This is a Civ server, and one man does not a nation make. Omnitopia holds on dearly to old alliances, and clings to the past when it should be fading into oblivion. The Fed is active, and growing, and making new friends. We will be announcing 2 new additions to the Wyck-Federation alliance soon, 2 active nations with 12 active players between them. If this server, this community, is going to grow and thrive its with nations like Wyck and The Fed, not the corpse of Omnitopia.  
  
Luni has hired mercenaries to pearl all members of Wyck and The Fed. He hasn't hired them to defend him, he's hired them to pearl us. As far as Wyck and The Federation are concerned this is a declaration of war.  
  
This is our response. The Wyck-Federation Alliance declares war on Omnitopia and all peoples who fight for it. This does not automatically include members of the Omni-Alliance, or anyone not in Omnitopia or Ares Company.
  
[Luni thought about leaving](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2se2wv/and_so_it_ends/), instead he stuck around to throw this server into war.

OGBobbyJohnson, MuffinMan, and I we're setting up a pub at our capital. We wanted to make some cool new brews because absinthe is made of grass and cow shit and we're basically just tired of it. I'm not going to deny, we have snitches in a lot of places. It's important! A lot of people don't like us, and it's good to know when people are coming for you.

Lo' and behold, we see four people heading out from Rev State and heading south. Coconut, PorkDork, NerdChops, and Nok. Typically not a big deal, right?

They get out a Greyshore and head south. Wait a sec, we're the only ones south, right? After we notice that they don't stop to get out at other places down the river, I give the order to go on alert.

Next they are heading down the Angstrom canal. They have four people clearly heading to us, while we have three people at our base. Due to both past and recent tensions between us I take it that they aren't here for anything good.

They get out at Angstrom and then aren't seen any more by our snitches. We split up and search for them. After a few minutes it becomes evident that they got out of the river and went through Angstrom's nether portal.

This is where we feel like an attack is imminent. Going through the portal, I notice that they headed south. Straight for our land. It seems that this was an attempt to get past our snitches. Two of their members die to falling and lava in the nether. I ask Nerd if he's having fun in here, and tell him that he's in our nether space. He acts like a total troll, it felt like talking to a /r/polandball comic. He says he wants to have a peace talk, and asks us to come to a certain location in the nether. We politely decline, and ask them if they would like to have a meeting on the other side of Angstrom's portal. They generally act like trolls, saying that they want to invite us to their alliance and that it will cost us 78 diamonds. (Also, Psst, Rev State, you owe me 40 diamonds still from the Angstrom conflict). They get drunk, not helping these 'negotiations.' Then they get attacked by mobs, and use this as ""We got attacked during the meeting with The Federation!"" Nice clickbait.

After we tell them to leave, they don't bother. Eventually Nerd heads into our farms and says ""Look at me, I'm trespassing! What are you going to do about it."" At this point we are tired of his shit, take out our sword and hit him, to which he instantly combatlogs.

Now to debunk his post.

&gt;All I wanted was peace. I didn't want war, I wanted to build Pyongyang, not watch it get destroyed. 
What? We haven't done anything to you. We haven't declared war, either. You are the one trespassing on our lands with a fighting force.

&gt;The Federation insulted us, called us names. We had a peace talk, they called Prynok rude names, and insulted him. I'm tired of it. I can not mentally handle this anymore.

Please cry more. If you wanted us to take you seriously you should have talked seriously. Not say ""i want yuo customor service! i only speak ching chong language!""

&gt;Nobody seems to see the Federation the same way I do. They toll a river and chased Prynok out of the tolling area. They attacked his horse during a peace meeting, and they are denying it. I have no proof, because I wasn't online. Prynok can't give proof that his horse was shot, he didn't take a picture. I am fed up no pun intended

I wasn't on then either, but Prynok still had his horse after the meeting, when I told him he would have to head out far away from our territory in 60 seconds and if he is still in my render  he will be pearled under suspicion of being part of an invasion force.

&gt;I went horseback from Pyongyang to Angstrom, thousands of blocks, feeling the rage of a thousand storms. I walked in angstrom territory, and was told to halt by the federation. They snitch everywhere they can. They snitched my house in Rev-State. They snitched Omnitopia. They even admitted to pry that they snitch all over the place.

Drama more please.

&gt;Nobody will do anything and I'm tired of it.

Here is my side of the story.

It all started when Kim told me to help him in the nether by the Angstrom base. I accepted, and I carried valuables for him in the nether. Some time between when they left to carry out a mission, I died due to taking a wrong turn and fell in lava. However, I respawned and over heard that they were going to Angstrom to have a meeting. I, helping Kim at the time, though it would be great to go over there and join the meeting. It all went well. Drinks  were drunk, Talks were talked, and it seemed to go good overall. However, I playing a drunk, starting ranting how they didn't give me tea they offered. This is where things took things to the worse. One thing lead to another, and before long, it was a name calling match about rat faces and cow faces. I was over at on the out skirts of their wall demanding a apology like the drunk I was. However, even though I wasn't on their land, they threatened to kill me. I ran back to angstrom, and they shot my horse. At this point I was screen shooting everything. I logged off to work on my website a bit, and when I got back on I continued role playing a drunk. However, when I went back I saw I was greeted with rape jokes. http://prntscr.com/65yjgn Shortly after this, Kim decided to make a point and went onto their soil, where they shot him. After this, Sharpcastle came over to me and threatened to pearl me for trolling, and trespassing. I logged off when Sharpcastle gave me 10 seconds to run away or I would be shot.",9,CivilizatonExperiment,,1571,10,,

Day 1

Set out from my current home of Sky Utopia. Took basic supplies, left plenty of empty space. Left a note for my partner at home and took off at sunrise. I spent my whole day walking, opting not to take a horse from the stables. Personally, I find travelling much more fun when one travels light and travels slow. It gives you time to think and bask in your surroundings. Sun warming my back, I descended from my sky city, said a brief farewell and went on my way. I will return of course, but it will be a while. 

My intended route is to head west to the river and follow it south to the sea, then from there continue west until I hit desert land. This is my homeland. While for now I cannot remain there, I will enjoy a visit. The intended plan may take longer than a more direct route, but frankly one stack of steak is all I have that I could pay toll with, and it wouldn't even by that by the time I got there.

On my way westwards, I stopped by Avaria, intending to say hello. Unfortunately, the city was empty, its residents elsewhere. I passed through and onwards to the river. Given that it was already noon, I opted to walk along the riverside for a while. Tomorrow I will set sail. For now, I am camped in a grove of trees and flowers. They are a waste of inventory space but I will admit to having taken several flowers with me. They have no use, but they are quite nice to look at.

Day 2
I awoke as the moon was setting, refreshed. I filled in my camp, and set off downriver. As I made my way downstream, I found myself surrounded by sheer cliffs. For a brief time it was wonderful, feeling enclosed with nothing but myself and the water rushing all around me. It was cut short as the terrain resumed its usual gentle hills. The forest, admittedly, gets a bit bland after a while. Arriving at the river's split, I went west towards the Survival Union.

The river is littered with boats abandoned by their crew. I wonder often what happened to them, and why they would leave the boats to rot. Dodging them and the hostile corpses was easy, dodging the squids was not. I have collected a decent amount of ink. If I can find some cane and leather, maybe I'll make a book. I had to leave mine at home as a note for Candle. 

I was slowed to a stop as a wall rose in front of me, cutting off the river. Confused, I gathered my boat and went inside. It looked to be a toll by all respects, but there was no one manning it. By all my knowledge (having spent a week in this land so far), there was no toll here. I poked around, found a tunnel underground and the start of sandy beaches on the other side of the wall.

It was tempting to move on without a word, but the hour was late. With the sun setting, I sat on the wooden bridge within the walls and decided to camp here for the night. I will deal with what may come in the morning. I hope they can be content with some flowers and half a stack of good beef, as it is most of what I have.",12,CivilizatonExperiment,,2965,13,Story,inquiry

I asked if he was merely sightseeing or using the portals to get home.

He said yes, and that he'd like to take a look as well. I said that's fine, provided you only take a look and do not mess with reinforced structures.

After a while, they leave, and I go check the area and find they have snitched my private railway as well as the island. I message Sharp about it, in order to ascertain their intentions and request the snitches be removed.

[Here is the full log of the conversation.](http://pastebin.com/6fDfW5y8)

Long story short. They will not remove the snitches and they wish to take Alpha from Omnitopia, by force if they must.

I was not going to post this log, but since Sharp decided to post a portion of his misrepresenting my words, I'm posting the full chat for clarity.

Thank you all for your consideration.

I was just going about my business, checking out the many flying balloons, cute little houses, giant sky farms, you know the drill! Macaroni II liked it as well, snorting the fresh air with glee. And then hell broke loose.

Without warning, horrifying creatures broke out of every nearby crevice, quickly blocking my and Macaroni II's sight. I tried to fight them off, frantically swinging my sword, pickaxe, stone blocks, *anything* that was near me around. Macaroni II was jumping, running and rearing, with me on his back. For 10, maybe 15 seconds (though it felt like an eternity) we fought, but alas, the creatures were too strong. As if we were made out of nothing, the creatures flung us off Sky Utopia, and Macaroni II and I collided with the cold, hard ground. 

I rushed my freshly reincarnated body back as fast as my borrowed horse could take me. My stuff still lay there, but who cares, right? Macaroni II lay dead. I buried him. Rest in peace, donkey.

As I put the last bit of dirt on Macaroni II's grave, I looked up at Sky Utopia. I couldn't see the creatures then, but I knew they were there. They were there... waiting. Just waiting for their next victim.

The Survival Union Market, or the SUM, is the first open market for everyone. Any nation can buy a booth and anyone can shop there.

###Where is the market?

The market is located in the west end of Port Tanzia, which can be found on [the map](http://mrkireko.github.io/CivEx/maps.html). You can get there by horse, boat, and foot. A railway from the north will open soon to allow faster travelling for people from the north.

###I want to buy stuff! What do I pay with?
The price for anything is 100% decided by the booth itself. It can be anything from apples to diamonds to cobblestone.

###My nation wants a booth! How do I get one?
Contact me for a booth!
Any nation can buy a booth for the low price of **5 diamonds**. At the moment, 7 booths are built. If more are needed, they will be built.  
The Survival Union will get **5%** of your income, rounded upwards. This means that 100 apples will get us 5 and you 95, and 5 apples will get us 1 and you 4.  
You have to bring any reinforcements or snitches yourself. If you plan to stop using your booth, you have to remove all reinforcements and snitches.

###How does it look?
[**Here's an album with pictures of the SUM!**](http://imgur.com/a/kuv45)

###I have a question!
Ask it! We will answer! :D

Although CivEx is a experiment, it is also a game. When something in the game suddenly gains control of the game, it needs to be nerfed. I.E. removing prot, adding ""bastions"" etc. 

Some of you may not have realised, but the only place on the server that has access to gold, has united and shut down its borders. This means that the price of gold will inflate drastically, as the A.G.E. now controls the actual price of the product, since they now have full authority over who can come in and out of their borders, and what comes in and out of the borders. 

Some of you may be asking yourself, *Why even be worried about 'gold'??* 

Gold controls the time you can vault players. CivExConspiracy failed to report on the conspiracy that the only reason the Feds teamed up with Wyck, was for gold so they could stockpile if they needed to vault any players. (Which is assuming they had to vault players)

*What does this mean for the server?*

Those 4 nations now control the PVP market. I tried to barter for land so people could allow Cacti and Acacia distribution to the server, but they denied me access to a claim of land. So that also means  those two products will go slightly up in price. 

----

Basically, I don't like what they're doing. It's unfair, it doesn't contribute to international politics, and nobody wants to pay a block of diamond for a block of gold. I'm really frustrated by this. Like actually upset that people are closing borders like factions servers on a political server.

K. Now downvote me, since that group is like 1/3rd of the server pop. at the moment.

Edit; I'm just frustrated in actions, since they can go everywhere, but we can't go there. And closing everyone's borders isn't healthy and gets boring.

***Farley War info***

If your nation entered in the Farley War, I need to collect your golden swords. I was hoping to do that this *Friday*, 2-27-15. I do not care if you wish to meet me in person to do it, or dropchest it and pm me coords. That choice is up to you. If you are unable to collect a gold sword by that time, please pm me and I will work something out for you.

So far I *do not* have swords from the following entered nations:

* Xhakúm

* Riviera

* The Reach

* Nexus

* Sky Utopia

* Wyck

Let me know if you would like to participate as a new nation, or if your nation would no longer like to be a part of this.

I *have collected* swords from the following nations:

* Revolution State

* Moria

Swords are in safekeeping, they will all be stored in my enderchest account.

**Name for the Farley War Style**

Suggest names please, in the format {Name suggestion: *Wizard Wars*}. I will make a strawpoll of all the names have have it up by Wednesday.

***Dates***

* Name voting: 2-25-15 *Voting will be counted and closed at midnight in US pacific timezone.*

* Swords are collected on Friday, 2-27-15 unless I am working with you.

* The **drawing** will be held on Saturday, *2-28-15* (If the public wishes to view this, please say so below. I can set a time and it would be in Moria's first hall at the table.) I may limit this to only nation leaders at the table and citizen spectators behind them if everyone wants to come.

I believe that is all for now! The date for the war has not been set, but it will be announced hopefully on Friday, one week *after the drawing.* Rules will be strictly kept, we do not tolerate stealing or harming of buildings. The official rules will be stated in the same post as the date announcement.

Rule layout:

* The league rules will remain roughly the same every war.

* The will be two sections that change per city. One section states city rules, and the other states rules that apply specifically in that region for the cities health. (No griefing like this, etc etc.)

**If your nation does not wish to participate, but you personally do, you can enter and be for “hire"" to a nation. However, it will cost 2 diamonds per player. (Pay the joining player, not me) I am working out specific things for this, stay with me.

That is all for now.

Our last thread devolved and started to move away from the main idea of what the Post War Tour is about: Promoting *peace* and *prosperity* throughout all the nations of CivEx. The war was stressful and put strain on the friendships in and around our community.

This tour is to celebrate the end of a conflict that affected all nations, as individuals who fought for what they thought was right. Let us stand together and have a fun memorial for all those involved. 

This is not about sides. 

This is about peace.

&gt;----


For several days, /u/raxusanode and I have been planning out a tour of nations in light of the most recent war. The idea was birthed shortly after /u/Bouer invited me to visit Moria after he freed me from the end. Raxus and I were discussing it, and decided it'd be great to visit every nation involved in the war to help make the event immortal.
We want to get some screenshots of the people who were part of the battles and make a huge album to forever remember WWI. As a two member team - one being a survivor of Pearl Harbor, and the other being the longest-kept Wyckish POW, we thought we could also swap some great stories with each nation that was involved.
Now, many of you weren't involved with the conflict. But that's fine with us, because we've got another simultaneous tour planned for you folks too. We're launching a book tour to give away free copies of our first series from Big Dwyck Publishing's stock. Be warned - the books contain mature content. That aside, if you're up for a casual read, be sure to grab absolutely free copies of The Lusty Brandywine Wench series when we're in town, and stay tuned for more to come.
If you're up for a visit, please post here. We hope you are as excited as we are!

Sincerely,

I think it's all been conducted in a healthy and educational way, and I think the server and the community is better for it. You've all been waiting patiently to hear A.G.E.'s mining and exportation policies, and quite a few of you have taken the time to voice your concerns about this kind of organization. We're fully aware we're the first of our kind, and we've read and reread all of your comments and posts. They have all been taken into consideration as we've developed our policies.  
  
A.G.E. is run by the leaders of its four nations, The Cooperative, Golden Horde, The Federation, and Wyck. We are all accountable to our separate citizens and, before we could agree on anything unanimously within A.G.E., we first had to get our own people to agree (not PACKERS, he's still so, so alone down there). This is not a simple process or organization. Regardless of A.G.E.'s long term impacts on the server, simply creating A.G.E. and getting it to operate smoothly will be a Civ Experiment all its own :)  
  
##Section 1 - The Stuff That Isn't Gold  
By collectively claiming (almost) all of the desert we have left some people concerned about the future access to things like Cactus, Acacia wood, Sand, and Colored Clay. A public cactus and acacia farm will be built by Wyck at the edge of the desert. We ask that those who use it refrain from breaking the bottom block of cactus, and plant at least as many saplings as trees they cut down, in order for future players to use it as well. Wyck will periodically check and maintain the farm. Sand and Colored Clay will continue to be available to everyone under normal trade interactions. If you want to pull sand or clay out of a nation's land, please ask for permission, or ask to trade first. We have lots and lots of it, we just don't want you leaving hideous scars or giant holes around our land.  
  
##Section 2 - Gold Exports  
All A.G.E. nations will commence exporting gold at a 1:1 Gold to Diamond ratio.

I found some fairly decent areas that weren't entirely Swiss cheese and, after an hour, left with 7 stacks of diamonds and enough XP to fully repair my pick when I got home. Once home I repaired my pick and set off to mine gold for 60 minutes. After an hour of mining virgin desert, and finding a few nice big caves which yielded a good amount of gold, I had mined 2.5 stacks of gold. After smelting the gold I had 14 levels, nowhere near enough to repair my pick.  
  
Diamonds are far more useful than gold - Weapons/Tools/Armor/Citadel, but like so many things in MC, value comes down to rarity and the time it takes to gather a particular resource. If the value of gold was based on the time it takes to acquire it alone, it would be traded at a 1:3 ratio, gold to diamonds (based on this one experiment). This is obviously absurd, but it begins to illustrate my point. We feel 1:1 is fair, and when it takes us an hour to mine 2.5 stacks of gold, and we trade it to someone for 2.5 stacks of diamonds that only took them 20 minutes to mine, we won't feel cheated. Gold is really the only thing the desert has to offer (nothing grows or breeds in the desert, in case anyone wasn't aware) so we're certainly going to try to get a fair price for our only natural resource of value. If you want to make a gold purchase you can contact any member of any A.G.E. nation. While we will all be selling at the same price we're still separate nations with separate economies, and will be fulfilling orders separately.  
  
##Section 3 - Public Access to Mining Gold  
The four nations which comprise A.G.E. control the vast majority of the desert, and therefor we are bound to develop new and fair policies regarding public access to sovereign lands. This is a dynamic previously unexplored on this server, to this scale, and we're fully aware that the policies we set forth today will be a living, breathing document that must evolve as the server's economics evolve. So please, as you read what's next, keep in mind that it is only the first iteration of this policy, and not something we are setting in stone for the rest of time. We're going to be learning how to fairly control the desert at the same time you all learn how to interact with a controlled desert.  
  
##Permits  
Gold mining access to outsiders will be based on obtaining a Gold Mining Permit. Twice a month, A.G.E. will hold a public auction on this subreddit to sell a finite number of mining permits. Permits will be good for a two week period, with two periods in each month - the 1st of the month to the 14th, and the 15th to the end of the month. Permits will be sold to individuals, not nations, and will grant the holder unlimited access to desert mining for the two weeks of their permit. The cost of permits will be determined by the server, through a public auction. Permit holders will be allowed to mine as much gold as they care to, and sell it on the open market at any price they deem fair, or keep it all for themselves. Permit holders will be issued books that contain their name and the dates their permit is good for, giving them free and safe access to the desert mining zone so long as their permit is valid. Permits are nontransferable, since they will contain the name of the owner.  
  
Individuals who wish to conduct business in the gold market, or obtain gold for their own use, will be able to do so, assuming they submit a winning bid during the auction. Each of the four nations in A.G.E. will create a public mine entrance on their eastern border (map image with mine entrances will be coming soon). Permit holders will be required to enter the desert at one of the four mine shafts, and will be restricted to mining at or below Y=60. This is to prevent miners from turning our hills and mountains into Swiss cheese.  
  
A.G.E. reserves the right to exclude any individual or nation from access to the public auctions for any reason. This should be obvious. If ImNotBanksy and the other lava worshiping heathens decide to invade the northern desert, A.G.E. would not continue to allow their members access to permits, and with them, unrestricted access to our lands ;) The first round of permits will be issued for, and public mine entrances will open on, March 1st.  
  
Gold exports from the nations of A.G.E. will resume immediately.  
  
##Section 4 - Enforcing A.G.E. Policies and Borders  
Some people have commented that the desert is far too big for any group to control. Clearly control of an area is simply a factor of the size of the area, the number of active players controlling it, and the number of snitches in it. While we do not wish to create a stranglehold on gold (as should be clear at this point from what you've read above), we certainly want to protect and enforce our borders and natural resources. There are over 1000 snitches in A.G.E.'s current snitch field. Between 100-300 more snitches are placed every day. The combined active player roster from all four nations is quite large, all members of all A.G.E. nations have access to the snitch field, and part of our active player roster includes The Fed ;)  
  
In addition to enforcing our own borders and policies, A.G.E. was approached by, and has since employed the services of, Phaxar's Ares Company. Ares Company will create and maintain an operational barracks within Wyck's land. This barracks will be located in the same area as the public farms and Wyck's mine entrance. Ares Company will both help enforce our borders as well as act as bounty hunters, seeking out and pearling gold thieves.  
   
We feel that we are creating fair and unique access to gold for everyone, in ways that promote new business opportunities for others, and make the need for unscrupulous individuals to steal gold from sovereign states unnecessary. As such, if individuals still feel compelled to act as criminals, the following punishments will be enacted on gold thieves.  
  
If you are caught mining/digging inside the desert without a permit you will be killed, but not pearled. Any ore on you will be confiscated, and the remainder of your possessions of value will be placed in a chest at A.G.E.'s permit issuing building, located in Wyck, near the public farms, for the thief to come get. Second offenders will not have any of their possessions returned. All members of A.G.E. and Ares Company have authority to stop players found in the desert and request to see a permit. Failure to provide a valid permit will result in the killing of players caught mining. Travelers will be asked to return to the edge of the desert (where sand and clay gathering should occur), and newfriends will be given supplies (like we always do) and sent on their way. If A.G.E. or Ares Company has to hunt down a gold thief outside the desert, they will be pearled and kept for 24 hours. Each addition offense will result in an additional 24 hours pearled. Again, we are trying to make it very easy for players to mine gold within our sovereign borders, if they go about it through legal means.  
  
##TL;DR  
Public Cactus and Acacia farm. Sand and Clay available for gathering respectfully and/or trading for.  
A.G.E. nations exporting gold at 1:1 Gold-to-Diamond ratio.  
A.G.E. nations are all selling gold at the same price, but operate independently.  
If you don't live in a desert nation you can gain access to our gold mines through a public auction of mining permits.  
Permits will be auctioned off on reddit and are good for a two week period.  
Permits will be unique to the individual who bought it and give them unlimited mining access for two weeks.  
Permit holders can sell the gold they mine on the open market for any price they deem fair.  
Ares Company Border Protection.  
Snitches.  
Gold thieves will be KOS. Their possessions will be returned. Any ore on them will be kept.  
Gold thieves who flee the desert will be hunted by A.G.E. and Ares Company and pearled.  
Repeat offenders will be pearled for longer periods of time.  
It's going to be pretty easy to get gold, whether its through a permit, purchasing from a permit holder, or from A.G.E.

Brand new map, updated as of 23-Feb-2015, should now show the lands of most of the new nations as well as updates to several old ones (SkyUtopia's Zeppelin, Rev State's Walls, etc). If your lands are still missing or outdated, let me know and I'll drop by to get new tiles.

New features in this version include several new nations, railways and locations marked. Lots of changes to planned roads as well. Check the full changelog for details.

I'd like to request the sidebar to be updated if possible. ""Updated map of the world"" should point to this thread, and ""Community map of all the nations/governments"" should point [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivilizatonExperiment/comments/2wnwxt/civilex_map_of_nations/) instead. =)

Many thanks to /u/MrKireko for keeping his mirror at the [Unnofficial CivilEx Website](http://mrkireko.github.io/CivEx/maps.html) updated, so here's a new one for you. ;)

As always, I'm open to criticism, corrections and suggestions.

All you have to do is drop off the amount of blocks and we will let you know when they are filled and ready to be picked up or delivered. We charge 10 diamonds per block filled and you can either pay up front or when the job is done. To schedule a drop off please pm me on here or message Twitchingtons in game.

I have already had a customer drop off 2 stacks of blocks to be filled so any other orders may be backlogged for a short while.

Please note that if you opt to pay after the blocks are filled and fail to deliver said payment, a bounty will be placed on you and Ares Industries will be hired to pearl you. Your blocks will be kept and your belongings will be confiscated.
