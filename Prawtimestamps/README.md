=============

It's all fresh all smooth

This creates an sqlite database file containing the submissions on a subreddit within the requested time span. Best when used in conjunction with an SQL viewer or a tool like Redmash to create text files.

If you leave the subreddit blank, it will ask you to enter a username instead. This feature is not 100% perfect yet.

Don't forget to change the Useragent before starting.

I want to live in a future where everyone uses UTC and agrees on daylight savings.
