Assigns flair to new posts based on the number of words within the selftext. The bot will wait `DELAY` seconds to give the user a chance to put his own flair. 

The flair selector will choose the lowest possible value in the dictionary.

{100:'Short', 200:'Medium', 300:'Long'} means 0-100 is Short, 101-200 is Medium, 201-inf is Long
