Probably one of my coolest bots so far. While running, this bot scans your subreddit for new posts, and checks if the user has ever posted there before. If not, they are added to the database and sent a polite welcome message; if so, it checks when their last post was. If their last post was too recent, it will get deleted and have a comment added to it telling them to read the rules.

The welcome message and warning message are not included in the USER CONFIG section. Scroll down to lines 80 and 104 to change these. They follow reddit's usual Markdown syntax.
