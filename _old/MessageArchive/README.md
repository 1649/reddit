Message Archive
==========

Export your mailbox to a text file.

Step 1: Edit the config at the top of the file to however you want.  
Step 2: `> messagearchive.py fetch` generates the database file. It can take some time.  
Step 3: `> messagearchive.py render` generates the text file. It's pretty quick.
