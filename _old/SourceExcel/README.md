When a user makes a post asking for help, AutoModerator will give  it the flair "Unsolved"

If an unsolved post has no comments, nothing happens

If an unsolved post receives a comment written by *someone other than OP*, the thread will get "Waiting on OP" flair.

If a Waiting thread does not have any comments written by OP, he has a limited amount of time to make a comment. His post will be removed if he does not participate in his own thread.

If a Waiting thread has no comments (meaning the original commenter deletd it), the bot will allow the post to stay until a new comment triggers it.

The code does have its loopholes, but only an unreasonable person will abuse them.
