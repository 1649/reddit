Measure the statistics of R4R interactions

This program tells you what you already know. There's no real point in running it.

It scans three of the four popular dirtyR4R subreddits, and measures the popularity of F4M posts and M4F posts. Posts made by females invariably gather more attention than posts made by males, but you can see for yourself.
