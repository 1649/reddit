WikiNames
=============

This bot will scan a subreddit for new submissions. The authors' names will be added to a wiki page as a hyperlink to that post. Only one entry will exist per user, pointing to their most recent post. Names are alphabetized with bold headers

See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/wiki/gold) for an example
