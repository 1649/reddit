reddit
======

A collection of reddit bots and utilities, all written by /u/GoldenSights. Many of these are done via /r/botrequests+requestabot, and some are done on a whim.

Previously, each bot had its own Repo. It didn't occur to me that I could just bundle them together. Those repos will no longer receive updates, but I will keep them open because I have a bunch of comments that point there.

Do not put multiple programs in the same folder. They use SQL databases to store information and you musn't allow them to mix.
