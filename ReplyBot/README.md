ReplyBot
========

The most basic bot. Searches a subreddit's comments for certain keywords, and replies to the comment if it finds any. You can have multiple keyword triggers, but you only have one reply out-of-the-box.

People ask for these all the time. Be aware of how spammy they can get. If people think your bot is stupid, they will report it. Use ReplyBot as a learning tool, but do not rehash old jokes for the sake of rehashed jokes.
