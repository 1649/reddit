BioWiki
=======


This bot gives every user who posts on the subreddit their own customizeable profile at /r/subreddit/wiki/<username>. When they make their first submission, the wiki page will be created and given some default text at the top, `WIKI_PAGE_INITIAL_TEXT`. That submission, and any submission they make in the future, will be placed underneath that. They can edit the wiki page to personalize it as much as they want
