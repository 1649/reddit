REDMASH
==========

While the other version may work, I only care about redmash_db currently.

This reads from an sqlite database and outputs into either .txt or .html a listing of all the submissions in the database sorted by date, score, title, author, and flair. The database must be of the form produced by my other script, Prawtimestamps, as they are meant to work best together.
