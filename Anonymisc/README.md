==========

By sending this bot a PM, it can post comments for you

The owners of the bot should put their username in the ADMINS list. They can add users to the whitelist.

For admins:

- Whitelist user or subreddit by sending the bot a message with this command at the very top. You cannot perform a whitelist action and commission a comment with the same message. One name or multiple separated by spaces. /u/ is implied if not specified:

        whitelist username
        whitelist /u/username
        whitelist /r/subreddit
        whitelist /u/username1 /u/username2 /u/username3

    When whitelisting, the bot does not check whether the username or subreddit is real. You're the owner of the bot, you can type whatever you want.

- Unwhitelist user. Same as above

        unwhitelist username1 /u/username2 /r/SubredditDrama 

- Display the current whitelist entries

        show

&nbsp;

Who can post:

- Admins, anywhere.

- Users on the whitelist, anywhere.

- Moderators of whitelisted subreddits, in that particular subreddit.
 
&nbsp;

How to post:

- Send a message to the bot with any subject. At the **very top** of the body, paste a URL pointing to a reddit comment or submission. You may use long-form links:

    https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/26r2ob/how_to_install_and_use_a_python_reddit_bot/

    or submission shortlinks:

    http://redd.it/26r2ob

- Leave a blank line, and then type your message. The rest of your message, in its entirety, will become the body of the comment.
