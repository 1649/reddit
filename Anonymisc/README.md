AnonyMisc
==========

By sending this bot a PM, it can post comments for you

[Here are the three fields you must fill out](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=GoldenSights&subject=Anonymisc&message=Permalink:%0A%0ALink%20Text:%0A%0ALink%20Url:). The bot will reply to the permalinked comment with a link. This bot supports user banlisting and whitelisting for security. Users may whitelist themselves if they type a secret password. Only the admins may manage banning. You may restrict which subreddits the bot will make comments in.

To display the name of the user who commissioned the comment (defeating the anonymity I guess) you can place "\_username_" (without quotes!) in COMHEADER or COMFOOTER and it will be automatically replaced.

The end result is an account which multiple people can comment from without ever knowing the password
